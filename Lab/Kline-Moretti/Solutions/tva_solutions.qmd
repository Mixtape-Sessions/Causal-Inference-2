title: "Tennessee Valley Authority Empirical Application"
format: gfm
---

## Intro

This exercise is going to work with data from Kline and Moretti (2014). This
paper aims to analyze the impacts of the "Tennessee Valley Authority" (TVA)
on local agriculture and manufacturing employment. The TVA was a huge federal
spending program in the 1940s that aimed at electrification of the region,
building hundreds of large dams (in Scott's terms, a ton of 'bite').

The region was centered in Tennessee and surrounding other southern states.
The region had a large agriculture industry, but very little manufacturing.
Electrification brought in a lot industry, moving the economy away from
agriculture. We are going to test for this in the data using census data
(recorded every 10 years).

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(fixest)
library(DRDID)
library(did)

options(readr.show_progress = FALSE, readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
setFixest_etable(markdown = TRUE)
```

First, we will load our dataset:

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/tva.csv")
head(df)
```

## Question 1

We will perform the basic 2x2 DID using just the years 1940 and 1960.
We will use as outcomes `ln_agriculture` and `ln_manufacturing`.

First, run the "classic" version using an indicator for treatment, `tva`,
and indicator for being the post-period, `post`, and the product of the two.
I recommend the package `fixest` for regression analysis. I'll be using it
in the solutions.


```{r}
est_40_60 <- feols(
  c(ln_agriculture, ln_manufacturing) ~ i(tva) + i(post) + i(tva * post),
  df |> filter(year == 1940 | year == 1960),
  cluster = ~county_code
)

```
```{r}
#| results: asis
etable(est_40_60)
```

Second, we will see in the 2x2 DID case, using county and time fixed effects is equivalent:


```{r}
est_40_60_full <- feols(
  c(ln_agriculture, ln_manufacturing) ~ i(tva * post) | county_code + year,
  df |> filter(year == 1940 | year == 1960),
  cluster = ~county_code
)

```
```{r}
#| results: asis
etable(est_40_60, est_40_60_full)
```

## Question 2

Moretti and Kline were nervous that the parallel trends assumption is
a bit of a strong assumption in the context. Why might that be in the
context of the Tennessee Valley Authority?

Answer: The TVA was built in the Tenneessee area precisely because the area
was not developing a strong manufacturing base. It is unlikely in the
absence of treatment that counties in the TVA area were going to grow in
manufacturing the same as outside counties

Let's run a placebo analysis to test for this using 1920 as the pre-treatment
period and 1930 as the post-treatment period. What does this tell us about
the plausability of a parallel trends type assumption?


```{r}
df$is_1930 <- (df$year == 1930)
est_20_30 <- feols(
  c(ln_agriculture, ln_manufacturing) ~
    i(tva * is_1930) | county_code + year,
  df |> filter(year == 1920 | year == 1930),
  cluster = ~county_code
)

```
```{r}
#| results: asis
etable(est_20_30)
```

## Question 3

Let's put this analysis together and run an event-study regression using
the full dataset

To do this, create a set of dummy variables that interact year with
treatment status. Estimate the TWFE model with these dummy variables.


```{r}
df$rel_year <- ifelse(df$tva == TRUE, df$year, 1940)

est_event_study <- feols(
  c(ln_agriculture, ln_manufacturing) ~
    i(rel_year, ref = 1940) | county_code + year,
  df,
  cluster = ~county_code
)

iplot(est_event_study[[1]])
iplot(est_event_study[[2]])
```

## Question 4

Let's use some controls to weaken the assumption to conditional
parallel trends. In particular, we are going to use a few covariates:
`agriculture_share_1920`, `agriculture_share_1930`,
`manufacturing_share_1920`, and `manufacturing_share_1930`.

What happens if we add those controls in linearly to our original estimate?

```{r}
feols(
  c(ln_agriculture, ln_manufacturing) ~
    i(rel_year, ref = 1940) +
      agriculture_share_1920 + agriculture_share_1930 +
      manufacturing_share_1920 + manufacturing_share_1930 |
      county_code + year,
  df,
  cluster = ~county_code
)
```

*Answer:* The covariates are dropped because they are collinear with the
county fixed effects.

The term $X_i \beta$ just causes a level shift in outcomes. This is not what
we want. We really want to allow for the *trends* in outcomes to vary by
covariate values. The simplest way to do this is to change our model to
interact covariates with indicators for each year $X_i * 1(t = s) \beta$ for
each year $s$. This is often written more simply as $X_i \beta_t$ which lets
$beta$ vary by year.

If you take first-differences, you end up with
$$
 X_i \beta_t - X_i \beta_{t-1} = X_i (\beta_t - \beta_{t-1}),
$$
which says changes in outcome over time depend on your value of $X_i$.
## Question 5

This question shows different weighs to incorporate covariates in a 2x2 difference-in-differences estimator. The goal is to relax our parallel trends assumption to be conditional on X:
$$
  E(Y_{i1}(0) - Y_{i1}(0) | D = 1, X = x) = E(Y_{i1}(0) - Y_{i1}(0) | D = 0, X = x).
$$

In words, this assumption says "take treated and control units with the same value of $X$. These units on average have the same counterfactual trend". Full details to help with this question are given below in the appendix notes. This question will walk you through three different covariates-based estimators of ATTs: outcome regression, inverse propensity of treatment weighting, and a doubly-robust combination of the two.

Note: Some of the data contains missing values for the covariates. Subset the data using `county_has_no_missing == TRUE` (for later).

```{r}
# Drop counties with missing covariates
df <- filter(df, county_has_no_missing == TRUE)

# First-differenced data
first_diff <- df |>
  arrange(county_code, year) |>
  filter(year == 1940 | year == 1960) |>
  mutate(
    D_ln_manufacturing = ln_manufacturing - lag(ln_manufacturing, 1),
    D_ln_agriculture = ln_agriculture - lag(ln_agriculture, 1),
  ) |>
  filter(year == 1960)
```

### Part 1: Difference-in-Differences
Take first-differences of the outcome variable to form $\Delta Y$. Create a new dataset that collapses the dataset using first-differences for the outcome variables (each county should be a single row in the dataset).

In part a, estimate the normal difference-in-differences estimate. Additionally, run a second model that linearly controls for `agriculture_share_1920`, `agriculture_share_1930`, `manufacturing_share_1920`, and `manufacturing_share_1930`.

```{r}
feols(
  D_ln_manufacturing ~ i(tva),
  data = first_diff
)

setFixest_fml(
  ..X = ~ agriculture_share_1920 + agriculture_share_1930 + manufacturing_share_1920 + manufacturing_share_1930
)
feols(
  D_ln_manufacturing ~ i(tva) + ..X,
  data = first_diff
)
```

### Part 2: Outcome Regression

Including covariates linearly is very simple and intuitively it allows for $X_i$-specific trends. However, this assumes that treatment effects can not vary by the value of $X$. For example, say $X$ is a dummy variable for age. Then you are allowing for gender-specific trends, but you are not allowing for treatment effects to vary by age. Note, this problem is only with continuous covariates in X_i, we won't estimate the ATT (see Angrist 1998 or Słoczyński 2022).

Instead, we want to use outcome regression when doing covariate adjustment in the outcome model. First, regress `D_ln_y` on the four covariates *using just the untreated observations* (`tva == 0`). This estimates $E(\Delta y | X, D = 0)$.

Second, predict out of sample this model for the full dataset. Let's call this `D_ln_y0_hat`. Last, take the difference between `D_ln_y` and the predicted `D_ln_y0_hat` and average this for the treated group (`tva == 1`). This is our outcome regression estimate.

```{r}
# Estimate E[Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} | D = 0, X] as a linear function of X
dy_est_0 <- feols(
  D_ln_manufacturing ~ ..X,
  data = first_diff |> filter(tva == 0)
)

# Use our estimate of E[Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} | D = 0, X] to predict for each observation given their value of x
Dy0_hat <- predict(dy_est_0, newdata = first_diff)

# Outcome regression estimate
Dy <- first_diff$D_ln_manufacturing
D <- first_diff$tva
N <- nrow(first_diff)

w1 <- 1 / mean(D) * D
mean(w1 * Dy) - mean(w1 * Dy0_hat)
```

With correct standard errors:

```{r}
X <- with(
  df[df$year == 1940, ],
  cbind(agriculture_share_1920, agriculture_share_1930, manufacturing_share_1920, manufacturing_share_1930)
)
DRDID::reg_did_panel(
  y1 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1960],
  y0 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1940],
  D = df$tva[df$year == 1960],
  covariates = X
)
```

### Part 3: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting

Now, lets use a propensity score method. Estimate a logistic regression of $D$ on the covariates $X$ using the full sample. Predict fitted propensity scores of this model.

Form the weights $w_1$ and $w_0$ as written in the appendix and form the IPTW estimate.

```{r}
# Fit propensity scores for treatment
ps <- predict(feglm(
  tva ~ ..X,
  data = first_diff, family = binomial()
))
# Avoid dividing by 0
ps <- pmin(ps, 1 - 1e-16)

# Generate propensity score weights for units
w1 <- 1 / mean(D) * D
w0 <- 1 / mean(D) * (1 - D) * ps / (1 - ps)

# This is our IPW estimate
mean(w1 * Dy) - mean(w0 * Dy)
```

With correct standard errors:

```{r}
DRDID::ipw_did_panel(
  y1 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1960],
  y0 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1940],
  D = df$tva[df$year == 1960],
  covariates = X
)
```

> [!WARNING]  
> The weights are the ones proposed originally in Abadie (2005). They are based on Horvitz-Thompson weights (1952, JASA). These are sensitive when there is problems with the overlap conditions. Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) (amongst others) suggest using Hajek weights, normalizing the Horvitz-Thompson weights by the sample mean of $w$. This is the default with `drdid::ipwdid`.
>
> For $w_0$, the Hajek weights are $\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}_n(D = 1)} \frac{(1-D) \hat{p}(X)}{1 - \hat{p}(X)} / \mathbb{E}_n(\frac{(1-D) \hat{p}(X)}{1 - \hat{p}(X)})$. The Hajek weights are unchanged for $w_1$ since $w_1 = \frac{D}{\mathbb{P}_n(D = 1)} / \mathbb{E}(\frac{D}{\mathbb{P}_n(D = 1)}) = w_1$.

```{r}
mean(w1 * Dy) - mean(w0 / mean(w0) * Dy)
DRDID::std_ipw_did_panel(
  y1 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1960],
  y0 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1940],
  D = df$tva[df$year == 1960],
  covariates = X
)
```

### Part 4: Doubly-Robust DID Estimator

From the previous questions, you have all the parts to estimate the doubly-robust DID estimator. Do this.

```{r}
mean(w1 * (Dy - Dy0_hat)) - mean(w0 / mean(w0) * (Dy - Dy0_hat))
```

With correct standard errors:

```{r}
DRDID::drdid_panel(
  y1 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1960],
  y0 = df$ln_manufacturing[df$year == 1940],
  D = df$tva[df$year == 1960],
  covariates = X
)

df$county_code_numeric <- to_integer(df$county_code)
X_fml <- ~ agriculture_share_1920 + agriculture_share_1930 + manufacturing_share_1920 + manufacturing_share_1930
DRDID::drdid(
  yname = "ln_manufacturing",
  tname = "year",
  idname = "county_code_numeric",
  dname = "tva",
  xformla = X_fml,
  data = df |> filter(year == 1940 | year == 1960),
  estMethod = "trad"
)
```

## Question 6

Now, let’s try using the `DRDID` package to do this more simply.

Note: DRDID requires the `idname` to be a numeric, so you need to create a new variable for this.

```{r}
# DRDID requires a numeric id
df$county_code_numeric <- to_integer(df$county_code)
X_fml <- ~ agriculture_share_1920 + agriculture_share_1930 + manufacturing_share_1920 + manufacturing_share_1930

DRDID::drdid(
  yname = "ln_manufacturing",
  tname = "year",
  idname = "county_code_numeric",
  dname = "tva",
  xformla = X_fml,
  data = df |> filter(year == 1940 | year == 1960),
  estMethod = "trad"
)
```

Note: I passed `estMethod = "trad"` to use the standard weights from Abadie (2005). Sant'Anna and Zhao propose an improved estimator that can be called `estMethod = "imp"`. This improvement is especially important when overlap is not perfect.

```{r}
DRDID::drdid(
  yname = "ln_manufacturing",
  tname = "year",
  idname = "county_code_numeric",
  dname = "tva",
  xformla = X_fml,
  data = df |> filter(year == 1940 | year == 1960),
  estMethod = "imp"
)
```

## Question 7

We are going to now use `did` to estimate an event study.
As a default, `did` calls `DRDID` under the hood. Let's see this using
`did::att_gt`. We need to create a variable for "treatment timing groups",
i.e. what year a county starts treatment. The package takes the convention
that group = 0 for never-treated group.


```{r}
# = 0 for never-treated, = 1950 for TVA counties
df$g <- df$tva * 1945
(attgt_man <- did::att_gt(
  yname = "ln_manufacturing",
  tname = "year",
  idname = "county_code_numeric",
  gname = "g",
  xformla = X_fml,
  data = df
))
did::ggdid(attgt_man)
```
