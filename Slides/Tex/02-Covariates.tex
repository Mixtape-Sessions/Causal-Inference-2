\section{Introducing difference-in-differences}


\subsection{Numerical examples}

\begin{frame}{Drake and David Card}

``Started from the bottom now we're here'' -- Drake

\bigskip

David Card and Orley Ashenfelter are often associated with it in economics, but it goes back further

\bigskip

Let's go back to the bottom and get to where we are now

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Miasma Debates}

\begin{itemize}

\item Difference-in-differences (DiD) was quietly and largely unnoticed introduced in the 19th century as a way to convince skeptics in health policy arguments
\item Dominant disease theory in 19th century was \emph{miasma} -- disease caused by smelly vapor
\item Keep in mind -- microorganisms would not be identified until much later, partly caused by poor resolution in microscopes (Freedman 2007)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Miasma I: Ignaz Semmelweis and washing hands}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1840s, Vienna maternity wards had high postpartum infections in one wing compared to other wings
\item One division had doctors and trainee doctors, but another had midwives and trainee midwives
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Miasma I: Ignaz Semmelweis and washing hands}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ignaz Semmelweis notes the difference in 1841 when hospitals moved to ``anatomical'' training involving cadavers (Pamela Jakeila lecture notes on DiD)
\item New training happens to one but not the other and Semmelweis thinks the mortality is caused by working with cadavers
\item Proposes washing hands with chlorine in 1847 in the midwives' wing and uses a DiD design of pre and post
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Miasma II: John Snow and cholera}

\begin{itemize}
\item Three major waves of cholera in the early to mid 1800s in London
\item John Snow believed cholera was spread through the Thames water supply which contradicted dominant theory about ``dirty air'' transmission
\item Grand experiment: Lambeth moves its pipe between 1849 and 1854; Southwark and Vauxhall delay
\item He can evaluate the effect in three ways (one of which is DiD)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Potential outcomes}



\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes review}

\begin{itemize}
\item DiD really can't be understood without committing to useful causality notation
\item Standard language is the potential outcomes model, sometimes called the Rubin-Neyman model
\item Potential outcomes are thought experiments about worlds that never existed, but which \emph{could have}
\item Important we are all on the same page, so I'm going to review this
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes notation}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Let the treatment be a binary variable: $$D_{i,t} =\begin{cases} 1 \text{ if pipe inlet is upstream at time $t$} \\ 0 \text{ if pipe inlet is downstream at time $t$} \end{cases}$$where $i$ indexes an individual observation, such as a person

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes notation}
	
	\begin{itemize}

	\item Potential outcomes: $$Y_{i,t}^j =\begin{cases} 1 \text{: health if drank from upstream at time $t$} \\ 0 \text{: health if drank from downstream at time $t$} \end{cases}$$where $j$ indexes a counterfactual state of the world

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Potential vs observed}

\begin{itemize}
\item A potential outcome $Y^1$ and an observed outcome $Y$ are distinct
\item Potential outcomes are \emph{hypothetical} possibilities describing states of the world but historical outcomes actually occurred
\item Potential outcomes become observed outcomes when treatments are assigned (the ``switching equation'') $$Y_{it}=D_{it}Y_{it}^1 + (1-D_{it})Y_{it}^0$$
\item I'll often drop the subscripts to reduce clutter, but note the key point here is one's own realized outcome at some point in time is based on one's own treatment assignment at that time (this is what we mean by SUTVA in fact)

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Treatment effect definitions}


	\begin{block}{Individual treatment effect}
	    The individual treatment effect,  $\delta_i$, equals $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$
	\end{block}

Individual causal effects cannot be calculated because one of the two needed potential outcomes will always be missing. Epistemologically ``unknowable'' in some important but difficult to define way.	
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Conditional Average Treatment Effects}	
	\begin{block}{Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)}
	The average treatment effect on the treatment group is equal to the average treatment effect conditional on being a treatment group member:
		\begin{eqnarray*}
		E[\delta|D=1]&=&E[Y^1-Y^0|D=1] \nonumber \\
		&=&E[Y^1|D=1]-\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0|D=1]}
		\end{eqnarray*}
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip
	
 Again that ``epistemological'' uncertainty.  We can estimate the ATT, but never be sure due to \textcolor{red}{missing potential outcomes} for the treated group

	
\end{frame}



\subsection{Identification}

\begin{frame}{Identification without randomization}

\begin{itemize}
\item We may be unable to randomize -- not because we lack the imagination, but because we lack the permission
\item If we cannot randomize, then how does DiD identify a treatment effect, and which treatment effect?
\item DiD identifies the ATT, and since we are missing $Y^0$ for treated group, we will restrict counterfactual $Y^0$ in expectation
\item One of the main advantages of DiD is the hope that we can identify the ATT \emph{without} randomization
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{DiD equation}

I call this the DiD equation, but Goodman-Bacon calls it the ``2x2''; I'll use his $k$ and $U$ notation for treated and untreated groups

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kU} = \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}$k$ index people with Lambeth, $U$ index people with Southwark and Vauxhall, $Post$ is after Lambeth moved pipe upstream, $Pre$ before Lambeth moved its pipe (baseline), and $E[y]$ mean cholera mortality. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DiD equation}

``Pre'' and ``Post'' refer to when Lambeth, $k$, was treated which is why it is the same for both $k$ and $U$ groups

\bigskip

If we had more than one treatment group, then ``Pre'' and ``Post'' no longer are defined for all units

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes and the switching equation}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kU} &=& \bigg ( \underbrace{E[Y^1_k|Post] - E[Y^0_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^0_U | Post ] - E[ Y^0_U | Pre]}_{\mathclap{\text{Switching equation}}} \bigg)  \\
&&+ \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y_k^0 |Post] - E[Y^0_k | Post]}}_{\mathclap{\text{Adding zero}}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Parallel trends bias}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kU} &=& \underbrace{E[Y^1_k | Post] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k | Post]}}_{\mathclap{\text{ATT}}} \\
&& + \bigg [  \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k | Post]} - E[Y^0_k | Pre] \bigg ] - \bigg [ E[Y^0_U | Post] - E[Y_U^0 | Pre] }_{\mathclap{\text{Non-parallel trends bias in 2x2 case}}} \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification through parallel trends}
	

	\begin{block}{Parallel trends}
	Assume two groups, treated and comparison group, then we define parallel trends as:	 $$\textcolor{red}{E(}\textcolor{red}{\Delta Y^0_k)} = E(\Delta Y^0_U)$$
	\end{block}

\textbf{In words}: ``The \textcolor{red}{evolution of cholera mortality for Lambeth \emph{had it kept its pipe downstream}} is the same as the evolution of cholera mortality for Southwark and Vauxhall''.  

\bigskip

It's in \textcolor{red}{red} so you know it's a nontrivial assumption.  But why?  Can't we just check?

	

	
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{What is ``The Science''?}

\begin{itemize}
\item You've probably heard people say RCT is the gold standard for causal inference.  But why?
\item Because randomization gives \emph{near certainty} that selection bias won't exist
\item Don Rubin commented once, ``we know how the science works''
\item DiD \textbf{does not} use ``the science'' though
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Identification with Independence (``the Science'')}


\begin{block}{Independence assumption}
Treatment is independent of potential outcomes  $$(Y^0,Y^1)\independent{D}$$
\end{block}	

RCTs use \emph{independence} to estimate causal effects; DiD does not

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Independence}

Independence allows us to write down conditional expected potential outcome equations (i.e., impute) like $$E[Y^0|D=1]=E[Y^0|D=0]$$ 

\bigskip

In the simple comparison in means, $\widehat{\delta}_{cs} = D + (L-SV)$, independence implies $L=SV$ (no selection bias).

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Parallel trends is hard}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{There is no guaranteed ``science'' in parallel trends}
\item IMO, this makes DiD a ``hard'' design -- \emph{because} it doesn't rely on randomization (it relies on parallel trends), there are no ``slam dunks'' and evidence tends to be multi-layered
\item Before we move into regression, let's go through a simple exercise to really pin down these core ideas with simple calculations
\end{itemize}

\section{Estimation}

\subsection{OLS Specification}


\begin{frame}{OLS Specification}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Simple DiD equation will identify ATT under parallel trends
	\item But so will a particular OLS specification (two groups and no covariates)
	\item OLS was historically preferred because
		\begin{itemize}
		\item OLS estimates the ATT under parallel trends
		\item Easy to calculate the standard errors
		\item Easy to include multiple periods
		\end{itemize}
	\item People liked it also because of differential timing, continuous treatments and covariates, but those are more complex so we address them later
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Minimum wages}

\begin{itemize}
\item Card and Krueger (1994) have a famous study estimating causal effect (ATT) of minimum wages on employment
\item Exploited a policy change in New Jersey between February and November in mid-1990s where minimum wage was increased, but neighbor PA did not
\item Using DiD, they do not find a negative effect of the minimum wage on employment which is part of its legacy today, but I mainly present it to illustrate the history and the design principles
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./lecture_includes/minwage_whore}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Card on that study}

\begin{quote}
``I’ve subsequently stayed away from the minimum wage literature for a number of reasons. First, it cost me a lot of friends. People that I had known for many years, for instance, some of the ones I met at my first job at the University of Chicago, became very angry or disappointed. They thought that in publishing our work we were being traitors to the cause of economics as a whole.''
\end{quote}

\bigskip

But let's listen to Orley's opinion about the paper's controversy at the time.  \url{https://youtu.be/MOtbuRX4eyQ?t=1882}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{OLS specification of the DiD equation}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The correctly specified OLS regression is an interaction with time and group fixed effects:$$Y_{its} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda d_t + \delta (NJ \times d)_{st} + \varepsilon_{its}$$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item NJ is a dummy equal to 1 if the observation is from NJ
		\item d is a dummy equal to 1 if the observation is from November (the post period)
		\end{itemize}
	\item This equation takes the following values
		\begin{itemize}
		\item PA Pre: $\alpha$
		\item PA Post: $\alpha + \lambda$
		\item NJ Pre: $\alpha + \gamma$
		\item NJ Post: $\alpha + \gamma + \lambda + \delta$
		\end{itemize}
	\item DiD equation: (NJ Post - NJ Pre) - (PA Post - PA Pre) $= \delta$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[plain]
	$$Y_{ist} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda d_t + \delta(NJ\times d)_{st} + \varepsilon_{ist}$$
	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.90]{./lecture_includes/waldinger_dd_5.pdf}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[plain]
	$$Y_{ist} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda d_t + \delta(NJ\times d)_{st} + \varepsilon_{ist}$$
	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.90]{./lecture_includes/waldinger_dd_5.pdf}
	\end{figure}

Notice how OLS is ``imputing'' $E[Y^0|D=1,Post]$ for the treatment group in the post period? It is only ``correct'', though, if parallel trends is a good approximation

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Violating parallel trends exercise}

Let's use the second tab now 

\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1onabpc14JdrGo6NFv0zCWo-nuWDLLV2L1qNogDT9SBw/edit?usp=sharing}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Violating parallel trends}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends are in expectation only -- we don't rely each state to follow the same trend, just the group average for $Y^0$ over the long difference
\item Violations happen due to selection bias as remember -- we are using untreated units as controls, only we are using their \emph{long differences} as the control outcome
\item Two straightforward ways that parallel trends will be violated
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compositional differences in samples associated with repeated cross-sections
	\item Policy endogeneity
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Repeated cross-sections and compositional change}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item One of the risks of a repeated cross-section is that the composition of the sample may have changed between the pre and post period in ways that are correlated with treatment
	\item Hong (2013) uses repeated cross-sectional data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) containing music expenditure and internet use for a random sample of households
	\item Study exploits the emergence of Napster (first file sharing software widely used by Internet users) in June 1999 as a natural experiment
	\item Study compares internet users and internet non-users before and after emergence of Napster
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain]

\begin{frame}[shrink=20,plain]

	\includegraphics{./lecture_includes/Hong_2.pdf}
	\end{figure}
	
	Diffusion of the Internet changes samples (e.g., younger music fans are early adopters)
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Repeated cross-sections}

\begin{itemize}
\item Surprisingly underappreciated problem with almost no literature around it
\item So what can you do?  Check covariate balance by regressing the time-varying covariates instead of the outcome onto the treatment using your OLS specification
\item They should be exogenous remember, so this covariate regression can be a helpful test of whether this is a problem
\item ``Difference-in-differences with Compositional Changes'' by Pedro Sant'anna and Qi Xu (not yet released) is the only paper I've ever seen to look into it
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Inference}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004) show that conventional standard errors will often severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators
	\item Standard errors are biased downward (i.e., too small, over reject)
	\item They proposed three solutions, but most only use one of them (clustering)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Inference}
	
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item[1 ] Block bootstrapping standard errors (if you analyze states the block should be the states and you would sample whole states with replacement for bootstrapping)
		\item[2 ] Clustering standard errors at the group level (in Stata one would simply add \texttt{, cluster(state)} to the regression equation if one analyzes state level variation)
		\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Most people will simply cluster, but there are issues if you have too few clusters
		
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inference}

\begin{enumerate}
		\item[3] Aggregating the data into one pre and one post period. Literally works if there is only one treatment data.  With staggered treatment dates one should adopt the following procedure:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Regress $Y_{st}$ onto state FE, year FE and relevant covariates
			\item Obtain residuals from the treatment states only and divide them into 2 groups: pre and post treatment
			\item Then regress the two groups of residuals onto a post dummy
			\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

No one does this, and I only mention it so you have it in your slides

\end{frame}


\subsection{Event studies in DiD}

	\end{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Evidence for parallel trends: pre-trends}

\begin{itemize}

	\item The identifying assumption for all DD designs is parallel trends, but since we cannot verify parallel trends, we often look at pre-trends
	\item It's a type of check for selection bias, but you must understand what it is and what it isn't to see its value but not be naive about it (it is not a silver bullet)
	\item Even if pre-trends are the same one still has to worry about other policies changing at the same time (omitted variable bias)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Plot the raw data when there's only two groups}

	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=2.5]{./lecture_includes/waldinger_dd_6.pdf}
	\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Evidence for parallel trends: pre-trends}

Let's do the bonus questions on first and second tab now 

\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1onabpc14JdrGo6NFv0zCWo-nuWDLLV2L1qNogDT9SBw/edit?usp=sharing}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Intuition behind event studies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel pre-trends are neither necessary nor sufficient for parallel trends
\item To argue otherwise is to commit a type of \emph{post hoc ergo propter hoc} fallacy
\item Parallel pre-trends is a type of ``look-alike'' reasoning we often do though
\item Similar to checking for covariate balance in RCTs
\item But \textbf{cannot} substitute for domain knowledge!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Event study regression}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Lags and lags can be included in our simple OLS model to analyze this issue
	\item The estimated regression would be:$$Y_{its} = \gamma_s + \lambda_t + \sum_{\tau=-2}^{-q}\mu_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+\varepsilon_{ist}$$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $D$ equals the treatment group interacted with the calendar year
		\item Treatment occurs in year 0, no anticipation, drop baseline $t-1$
		\item Includes $q$ leads or anticipatory effects
		\item Includes $m$ lags or post treatment effects
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Event study regression}


$$Y_{its} = \gamma_s + \lambda_t + \sum_{\tau=-2}^{-q}\mu_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+\varepsilon_{ist}$$

\bigskip

Typically you'll plot the coefficients and 95\% CI on all leads and lags (binned or not, trimmed or not) 

\bigskip

Under parallel trends and no anticipation, then you expect $\widehat{\mu}$ coefficients to be zero, which gives you confidence that parallel trends holds (but is not a guarantee, and there are still specification issues -- see Jon Roth's work)

		\item Falsification test using data for alternative control group (e.g., Medicare population)
		\item Falsification test using alternative ``placebo'' outcome that should not be affected by the treatment

Sometimes, an empirical literature may be criticized using nothing more than placebo analysis

\begin{quote}``A majority of [our] respondents believe the literature is a success story that demonstrates the power of economic reasoning.  At the same time, they also believe the empirical evidence is weak, and they disagree both on the type of evidence that would validate the theory and the policy implications. Taken together, this points to an interesting gap.  On the one hand, most of the respondents claim that the theory has valuable real world implications.  On the other hand, they do not believe the theory has received empirical support.''

\section{Including Covariates}

\subsection{Inverse probability weighting}

\begin{frame}{Controls}

\begin{itemize}
\item Controls can address omitted variable bias (backdoor criterion), and they can improve precision
\item OLS can accommodate controls, and so we tend to include them so long as they are time varying 
\item But unfortunately, time varying covariates can create problems, especially if the treatment causes the covariates (bad controls, colliders)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}






\begin{frame}{Inverse probability weighting DiD}

 Abadie (2005) incorporates baseline covariates into the propensity score which are then used as weights to estimate the ATT in a simple 3-step process
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate each unit's ``after minus before'' (DiD equation)
	\item Estimate the conditional probability of treatment based on baseline covariates (propensity score estimation)
	\item Weight the comparison group's DiD equation with the IPW
	\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item $t$ is year of treatment which doesn't vary across units (so no differential timing)
\item $Y^1$ and $Y^0$ are potential outcomes (counterfactual versus actual)
\item $D$ is 1 or 0 based on group and time
\item $X_b$ are ``baseline'' covariates \textbf{only} -- they do not vary over time, which means propensity scores are estimated off the $b$ period \textbf{only}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}

Kind of common for this propensity score literature to only have two assumptions.  But usually the first conditional independence.  Now it is parallel trends because this is DD

\begin{enumerate}
\item Conditional parallel trends $$E[Y^0_t - Y^0_b|D=1,X_b] - E[Y^0_t - Y^0_t | D=0, X_b]$$ (Notice the $b$ subscript.  What is that you think?)
\item Common support $$Pr(D=1)>0; Pr(D=1|X)<1$$ Let's see a picture of common support that I drew.  Apologies it's horrible
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Common support}

As we are identifying the ATT, we only need common support with respect to treated units

\bigskip

Your identify assumptions are always with respect to the missing covariates in other words and for the ATT, you are missing $Y^0$ for the treatment group

\bigskip

If we were estimating ATU, we'd be missing $Y^1$ for controls and need common support ($Y$ in treatment for all ranges of control), and for ATE we'd need both

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Propensity scores}

\begin{itemize}
\item It's common to hear people say that we don't know the propensity score; we can only estimate it. Same here -- we approximate it with regressions
\item Paper is titled ``Semi-parametric DiD'' because Abadie imposes structure on the polynomials used to construct the propensity score (``series logit'')

\subsection{Double Robust DiD}

\begin{frame}{Doubly Robust Difference-in-differences}

\begin{itemize}
\item DR models control for covariates twice -- once using the propensity score, once using outcomes adjusted by regression -- and are unbiased so long as:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The regression specification for the outcome is correctly specified
	\item The propensity score specification is correctly specified
	\end{itemize}
\item Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) incorporated DR into DiD by combining inverse probability weighting and outcome regression into a single DiD model
\item It's in the engine of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) that we discuss later so it merits close study
\item One of my favorite lesser known of the new DiD papers
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Patterns in econometrician reasoning}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Define the target parameter first (as opposed to writing down a regression specification first)
\item Identification (e.g., parallel trends)
\item Estimation
\item Aggregation
\item Inference
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Defining the target parameter}

Major part of the new econometrics is to always start with the target parameter and build to it using estimation and identification that ``works''

\bigskip

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta = E[Y^1_{it} - Y^0_{it} | D_i=1]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification assumptions I: Data}

Assumption 1: Assume panel data or repeated cross-sectional data

\bigskip

Handling repeated cross-sectional data is possible but assumes modularity which is a kind of stability assumption, but I'll use panel representation. 

\bigskip

Cross-sections will be potentially violated with changing sample compositions (e.g., the Napster example). 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification assumptions II: Modification to parallel trends}

Assumption 2: Conditional parallel trends

\bigskip

Counterfactual trends for the treatment group are the same as the control group for all values of $X$

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y_1^0 - Y_0^0 | X, D=1] = E[Y^0_1 - Y^0_0 | X, D=0]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification assumptions III: Common support}

Assumption 3: Common support

\bigskip

For some $e>0$, the probability of being in the treatment group is greater than $e$ and the probability of being in the treatment group conditional on $X$ is $\leq1-e$. 

\bigskip

Intuition of assumption 3: Called overlap or common support. Means there is at least a small fraction of the population that is treated and that for every value of the covariates $X$ there is at least a small chance that the unit is not treated. It's called common support when it's a propensity score but it's just about the distribution of treatment and control across values of $X$. Very common when dealing with covariate comparisons as otherwise you're extrapolating (curse of dimensionality)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimating DD with Assumptions 1-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumptions 1-3 gives us a couple of options of estimating the DiD
\item We can either use the outcome regression (OR) approach of Heckman, et al 1997
\item Or we can use the inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach of Abadie (2005)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Heckman, et al. 1997}

	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{./lecture_includes/petra_restud_1997}
	\end{figure}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Outcome regression}

This is the Heckman, et al. (1997) approach where the outcome evolution is modeled with a regression

\bigskip

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{OR} = \overline{Y}_{1,1} - \bigg [ \overline{Y}_{1,0} + \frac{1}{n^T} \sum_{i|D_i=1} ( \widehat{\mu}_{0,1}(X_i) - \widehat{\mu}_{0,0}(X_i)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\overline{Y}$ is the sample average of $Y$ among units in the treatment group at time $t$ and $\widehat{\mu}(X)$ is an estimator of the true, but unknown, $m_{d,t}(X)$ which is by definition equal to $E[Y_t|D=d,X=x]$.

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Outcome regression}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{OR} = \overline{Y}_{1,1} - \bigg [ \overline{Y}_{1,0} + \frac{1}{n^T} \sum_{i|D_i=1} ( \widehat{\mu}_{0,1}(X_i) - \widehat{\mu}_{0,0}(X_i)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Regress changes $\Delta Y$ on $X$ among untreated groups using baseline covariates only
\item Get fitted values of the regression using all $X$ from $D=1$ only.  Average those
\item Calculate change in this fitted $Y$ among treated with the average fitted values
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inverse probability weighting}

This is the Abadie (2005) approach where we use weighting

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{ipw} = \frac{1}{E_N[D]} E \bigg [ \frac{D-\widehat{p}(X)}{1-\widehat{p}(X)} (Y_1-Y_0) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\widehat{p}(X)$ is an estimator for the true propensity score. Reduces the dimensionality of $X$ into a single scalar.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{These models cannot be ranked}

\begin{itemize}
\item Outcome regression needs $\widehat{\mu}(X)$ to be correctly specified, whereas
\item Inverse probability weighting needs $\widehat{p}(X)$ to be correctly specified
\item It's hard to ``rank'' these two in practice with regards to model misspecification because each is inconsistent when their own models are misspecified
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{TWFE}

Consider our earlier TWFE specification:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{it} = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 T_t + \alpha_3 D_i +  \delta (T_i \times D_t)  + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Just add in covariates then right?

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{it} = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 T_t + \alpha_3 D_i  + \delta (T_i \times D_t) + \theta \cdot X_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{eqnarray*}

Sure! If you're willing to impose three \emph{more} assumptions

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Decomposing TWFE with covariates}

TWFE places restrictions on the DGP. Previous TWFE regression under assumptions 1-3 implies the following:

\bigskip

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y^1_1|D=1,X] = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Conditional parallel trends implies

\small
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&E[Y^0_{1} - Y^0_{0}|D=1,X]= E[Y^0_{1} - Y^0_{0}|D=0,X] \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] - E[Y^0_{0}|D=1,X]= E[Y^0_{1}|D=0,X] - E[Y^0_{0}|D=0,X] \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = E[Y^0_{0}|D=1,X] + E[Y^0_{1}|D=0,X] - E[Y^0_{0}|D=0,X] \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = E[Y_{0}|D=1,X] + E[Y_{1}|D=0,X] - E[Y_{0}|D=0,X] \\
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Switching equation substitution}

Last line from the switching equation. This gives us:

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \theta X
\end{eqnarray*}

Now compare this with our earlier $Y^1$ expression

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y^1_1|D=1,X] = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X
\end{eqnarray*}

We can define our target parameter, the ATT, now in terms of the fixed effects representation

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Collecting terms}

TWFE representation of our conditional expectations of the potential outcomes
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&E[Y^1_1|D=1,X] = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta_1 X \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \theta_2 X \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Substitute these into our target parameter

\begin{eqnarray*}
ATT &=& E[Y^1_1|D=1,X]  - E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X]   \\
&&=(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta_1 X) - ( \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \theta_2 X )\\
&&=\delta + (\theta_1 X - \theta_2 X)
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

What if $\theta_1 X \neq \theta_2 X$?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumption 4: Homogeneous treatment effects in X}


TWFE requires homogenous treatment effects in $X$ (i.e., the treatment effect is the same for all $X$)

\bigskip

If $X$ is sex, then effects are the same for males and females.

\bigskip

  If $X$ is continuous, like income, then the effect is the same whether someone makes \$1 or \$1 million.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{X-specific trends}

TWFE also places restrictions on covariate trends for the two groups too.  Take conditional expectations of our TWFE equation. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y_1|D=1] &=& \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X_{11} \\
E[Y_0|D=1] &=& \alpha_1 + \alpha_3 + \theta X_{10} \\
E[Y_1|D=0] &=& \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \theta X_{01} \\
E[Y_0|D=0] &=& \alpha_1 + \theta X_{00}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{X-specific trends}

Now take the DiD formula:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{DD} = &&\bigg ( (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X_{11} ) - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 + \theta X_{10} ) \bigg )- \\
&& \bigg ( (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \theta X_{01}) - (\alpha_1 + \theta X_{00}) \bigg )
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Eliminating terms, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{DD} = &&\delta + \\
&& (\theta X_{11} - \theta X_{10} ) - (\theta X_{01} - \theta X_{00} )
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Second line requires that trends in X for treatment group equal trends in X for control group.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 5 and 6}

We need ``no X-specific trends'' for the treatment group (assumption 5) and comparison group (assumption 6)

\bigskip

\textbf{Intuition}: No X-specific trends means the evolution of potential outcome $Y^0$ is the same regardless of $X$. This would mean you cannot allow rich people to be on a different trend than poor people, for instance.

\bigskip

Without these six, in general TWFE will not identify ATT. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why not both?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let's review the problem.  What if you claim you need $X$ for conditional parallel trends?
\item You have three options:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Outcome regression (Heckman, et al. 1997) -- needs Assumptions 1-3
	\item Inverse probability weighting (Abadie 2005) -- needs Assumptions 1-3
	\item TWFE (everybody everywhere all the time) -- needs Assumptions 1-6
	\end{enumerate}
\item Problem is 1 and 2 need the models to be correctly specified
\item Doubly robust combines them to give us insurance; we now get two chances to be wrong, as opposed to just one
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Double Robust DiD}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{dr} = E \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac{D}{E[D]} -\frac{ \frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} }{E \bigg [\frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} \bigg ]} \bigg  )( \Delta Y - \mu_{0,\Delta}(X)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
&&p(x): \text{propensity score model} \\
&& \Delta Y = Y_1 - Y_0 = Y_{post} - Y_{pre} \\
&& \mu_{d,\Delta} = \mu_{d,1}(X) - \mu_{d,0}(X), \text{ where } \mu(X) \text{ is a model for} \\
&& m_{d,t} = E[Y_t|D=d,X=x]
\end{eqnarray*}So that means $\mu_{0,\Delta}$ is just the control group's change in average $Y$ for each $X=x$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Double Robust DiD}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{dr} = E \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac{D}{E[D]} -\frac{ \frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} }{E \bigg [\frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} \bigg ]} \bigg  )( \Delta Y - \mu_{0,\Delta}(X)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

Notice how the model controls for $X$: you're weighting the adjusted outcomes using the propensity score

\bigskip

The reason you control for $X$ twice is because you don't know which model is right.  DR DiD frees you from making a choice without making you pay too much for it

There is code in R and Stata (all DiD estimators are now beautifully arranged at a website hosted by Asjad Naqvi)
\begin{itemize}
\item Stata: \textbf{drdid}
\item R: \textbf{drdid}

Remember -- it's for 2x2 with covariates (i.e., one treatment group).

\begin{frame}{Application using real data}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let's now use a real example with real data and see how well this does
\item Famous paper in AER by Lalonde (1986), an Orley and Card student at Princeton
\item Found that most program evaluation did badly, but let's revisit it with diff-in-diff
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Description of NSW Job Trainings Program}
	
The National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW), operated by Manpower Demonstration Research Corp in the mid-1970s:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item was a temporary employment program designed to help disadvantaged workers lacking basic job skills move into the labor market by giving them work experience and counseling in a sheltered environment
	\item was also unique in that it \textbf{randomly assigned} qualified applicants to training positions:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Treatment group}: received all the benefits of NSW program
		\item \textbf{Control group}: left to fend for themselves
		\end{itemize}
	\item admitted AFDC females, ex-drug addicts, ex-criminal offenders, and high school dropouts of both sexes
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NSW Program}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Treatment group members were:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item guaranteed a job for 9-18 months depending on the target group and site
		\item divided into crews of 3-5 participants who worked together and met frequently with an NSW counselor to discuss grievances and performance
		\item paid for their work
		\end{itemize}
	\item Control group members were randomized so the same
	\item Note: the randomization balanced observables and unobservables across the two arms, thus enabling the estimation of an ATE for the people who self-selected into the program
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NSW Program}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Other details about the NSW program:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \underline{Wages}:  NSW offered the trainees lower wage rates than they would've received on a regular job, but allowed their earnings to increase for satisfactory performance and attendance
		\item \underline{Post-treatment}: after their term expired, they were forced to find regular employment
		\item \underline{Job types}:  varied within sites -- gas station attendant, working at a printer shop -- and males and females were frequently performing different kinds of work
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
	
\begin{frame}{NSW Data}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{NSW data collection}:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item MDRC collected earnings and demographic information from both treatment and control at baseline and every 9 months thereafter
		\item Conducted up to 4 post-baseline interviews
		\item Different sample sizes from study to study can be confusing, but has simple explanations
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
	

\begin{frame}{NSW Data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{Estimation}:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item NSW was a randomized job trainings program; therefore estimating the average treatment effect is straightforward:
			\begin{eqnarray*}
			\frac{1}{N_t}\sum_{D_i=1}Y_i - \frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{D_i=0}Y_i \approx E[Y^1-Y^0] 
			\end{eqnarray*}in large samples assuming treatment selection is independent of potential outcomes (randomization) -- i.e., $(Y^0,Y^1)\independent{D}$. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item \underline{NSW worked}: Treatment group participants' real earnings post-treatment (1978) was positive and economically meaningful -- $\approx$ \$900 (LaLonde 1986) to \$1,800 (Dehejia and Wahba 2002) depending on the sample used
\end{itemize}

	\end{center}
	
\underline{LaLonde's study} was \textbf{not} an evaluation of the NSW program, as that had been done, but rather an evaluation of econometric models done by:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item replacing the experimental NSW control group with non-experimental control group drawn from two nationally representative survey datasets: Current Population Survey (CPS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
		\item estimating the average effect using non-experimental workers as controls for the NSW trainees 
		\item comparing his non-experimental estimates to the experimental estimates of \$900
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{LaLonde (1986)}

\begin{itemize}

	\item \underline{LaLonde's conclusion}: available econometric approaches were biased and inconsistent
		\begin{itemize}
		\item His estimates were way off and usually the wrong sign
		\item Conclusion was influential in policy circles and led to greater push for more experimental evaluations
		\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item So we hopefully see a few of the key elements of DiD
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Remember: the DiD equation and ATT equation are distinct concepts and definitions
	\item DiD is a design; OLS is a model
	\item Also, parallel pre-trends and parallel trends are distinct -- the first is testable, the latter is not testable
	\item Event studies are nonetheless mandatory
	\end{itemize}
\item Including \emph{time-varying} covariates in the canonical OLS specification requires additional assumptions
\item Doubly robust and IPW incorporate covariates through propensity scores and outcome regressions (or both) using baseline covariate means only
\end{itemize}
