\section{Differential timing}

\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Differential timing outline}

We will cover some of the properties of twoway fixed effects (TWFE), some solutions and my personal opinions

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduce TWFE as a panel estimator and its use in DiD
	\item TWFE Pathologies in static specification
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Goodman-Bacon decomposition as diagnosis of the problem
		\item Aggregating group-time ATT to weaken assumptions
		\end{itemize}
	\item TWFE Pathologies in event study specification
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Sun and Abraham as both a diagnosis and a cure 
		\item Comparing with Callaway and Sant'anna
		\end{itemize}
	\item Application, practical advice and code
\end{enumerate}

With some exception (e.g., Heckman, Ichimura and Todd 1997; Abadie 2005; Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainthan 2004), econometricians had not given it much notice

\end{frame}







\begin{frame}{Difference-in-differences credibility crisis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Many simultaneous discoveries, some redundancies, and \textbf{sudden} awareness of the issues started happening around 2017
\item Extreme meteoric rise, unusual for econometrics, has become very influential and expectations have changed
\item Important to learn this material given the popularity of diff-in-diff (at minimum for your readings)
\item Many survey articles out there, so this has to be selective
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Differential Timing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Differential timing refers to when groups of panel units (e.g., states, countries) receive the same treatment at different calendar dates
\item Ordinarily, we are interested in knowing something about its effect, but what if there is not single one effect?
\item What if the effects of the intervention differ for the earlier groups treated than the late ones, or if if the effects change over time?
\item Then the standard twoway fixed effects estimator may be biased
\item But first we learn what I mean by the "standard twoway fixed effects estimator"
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\subsection{TWFE Estimator }





\begin{frame}{Two Regression Models}

\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{ist} &=& \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Treat_{is} + \alpha_2 Post_{t} + \delta (Treat_{is} \times Post_t) + \varepsilon_{ist} \\
Y_{ist} &=& \beta_0 + \delta D_{ist} + \tau_t + \sigma_s + \varepsilon_{ist}
\end{eqnarray}

\bigskip

First equation is used for simple designs when everyone is treated at once; second equation was used when different groups were treated at different times (``differential timing'')

\bigskip

First equation works; second one only sometimes works

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Equivalence}
$$Y_{ist} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Treat_{is} + \alpha_2 Post_{t} + \textcolor{blue}{\delta} (Treat_{is} \times Post_t) + \varepsilon_{ist} $$

\bigskip

$$\widehat{\textcolor{blue}{\delta}} = \bigg ( \overline{y}_k^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_k^{pre(k)} \bigg ) - \bigg ( \overline{y}_U^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_U^{pre(k)} \bigg ) $$

\begin{itemize}
\item Regression estimates of $\delta$ and the ``four averages and three subtractions'' are the same thing numerically (show code)
\item And under a particular assumption, they are also unbiased estimates of an aggregate causal parameter
\item But this is in the case of a 2x2 -- one group treated in time period $t$, and another group that isn't. 
\item What would people do when it wasn't a 2x2?  They'd use a different specification of TWFE.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}









\begin{frame}{Twoway fixed effects}

\begin{itemize}
\item When working with panel data, the so-called TWFE estimator is the workhorse estimator
\item It's easy to implement, handles time-varying treatments, has a relatively straightforward interpretation under constant treatment effects, standard errors are easy to calculate and understand
\item Interpretation is more complicated with heterogenous treatment effects
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Types of repeating data}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Panel datasets follow the same units (individuals, firms, countries, schools, etc.) over several time periods
	\item Repeated cross-sections will sample a population for a given area, but not be the same people or units in that area
	\item Difference-in-differences accommodates either, but panel estimators are about the first 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Panel estimators}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Panel estimators estimate causal effects in situations where there are unobserved factors associated with the treatment variable creating endogeneity problems
	\item Less about identification under parallel trends and more about modeling unobservables as unchanging over time (``time invariant'')
	\item Fixed effects estimation eliminate the unobserved confounder through a demeaning process while retaining the identification of the treatment parameter under constant treatment efects
	\item Heterogenous treatment effects are part of the problem after that
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Directed acyclic graph showing when to use TWFE

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{When not to use it}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reverse causality: Becker predicted police reduce crime, but when you regress crime onto police, it's usually positive
			\begin{itemize}
			\item TWFE requires an assumption that rules out reverse causality
			\item For those, you typically need an instrument
			\end{itemize}

		\item Time-varying unobserved variables that are correlated with the treatment and the outcome
			\begin{itemize}
			\item It's the time-varying unobservables you have to worry about in fixed effects
			\item Can include time-varying controls, but as always, don't condition on an outcome (i.e., collider)
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Notation}

	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $y$ and $x\equiv(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k)$ be observable random variables and $c$ be an unobservable random variable
	\item We are interested in the partial effects of variable $x_j$ in the population regression function$$E[y|x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k,c]$$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Notation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We observe a sample of $i=1,2,\dots,N$ cross-sectional units for $t=1,2,\dots,T$ time periods (a balanced panel)
		\begin{itemize}
		\item For each unit $i$, we denote the observable variables for all time periods as $\{(y_{it},x_{it}):t=1,2,\dots,T\}$
		\item $x_{it}\equiv(x_{it1},x_{it2}, \dots, x_{itk})$ is a $1\times K$ vector
		\end{itemize}
	\item Typically assume that cross-sectional units are i.i.d. draws from the population: $\{y_i, x_i, c_i\}^N_{i=1}\sim i.i.d.$ (cross-sectional independence)
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $y_i \equiv (y_{i1}, y_{i2}, \dots, y_{iT})'$ and $x_i \equiv (x_{i1},x_{i2}, \dots, x_{iT})$
		\item Consider asymptotic properties with $T$ fixed and $N\rightarrow \infty$
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\end{array} \right)_{NT \times K}
\]


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unobserved heterogeneity}

	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item For a randomly drawn cross-sectional unit $i$, the model is given by $$y_{it} = x_{it}\beta + c_i + \varepsilon_{it}, \text{   }t=1,2,\dots,T$$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $y_{it}$: log wages $i$ in year $t$
		\item $x_{it}:1 \times K$ vector of variable events for person $i$ in year $t$, such as education, marriage, etc. plus an intercept
		\item $\beta: K\times 1$ vector of marginal effects of events
		\item $c_i$: sum of all time-invariant inputs known to people $i$ (but unobserved for the researcher), e.g., ability, beauty, grit, etc., often called unobserved heterogeneity or fixed effect
		\item $\varepsilon_{it}$: time-varying unobserved factors, such as a recession, unknown to the farmer at the time the decision on the events $x_{it}$ are made, sometimes called idiosyncratic error
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Pooled OLS}

\begin{itemize}
	\item When we ignore the panel structure and regress $y_{it}$ on $x_{it}$ we get$$ y_{it}=x_{it}\beta + v_{it}; \text{    }t=1,2,\dots,T$$with composite error $v_{it} \equiv c_i + \varepsilon_{it}$
	\item What happens when we regress $y_{it}$ on $x_{it}$ if $x$ is correlated with $c_i$?
	\item Then $x$ ends up correlated with $v$, the composite error term.
	\item Somehow we need to eliminate this bias, but how?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pooled OLS}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Main assumption to obtain consistent estimates for $\beta$ is:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $E[v_{it} | x_{i1},x_{i2}, \dots, x_{iT}] = E[v_{it} | x_{it}] = 0$ for $t=1,2,\dots, T$
			\begin{itemize}
			\item $x_{it}$ are strictly exogenous: the composite error $v_{it}$ in each time period is uncorrelated with the past, current and future regressors
			\item But: education $x_{it}$ likely depends on grit and ability $c_i$ and so we have omitted variable bias and $\widehat{\beta}$ is not consistent
			\end{itemize}
		\item No correlation between $x_{it}$ and $v_{it}$ implies no correlation between unobserved effect $c_i$ and $x_{it}$ for all $t$
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Violations are common: whenever we omit a time-constant variable that is correlated with the regressors (heterogeneity bias)
			\end{itemize}
		\item Additional problem: $v_{it}$ are serially correlated for same $i$ since $c_i$ is present in each $t$ and thus pooled OLS standard errors are invalid
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pooled OLS}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Always ask: is there a time-constant unobserved variable ($c_i$) that is correlated with the regressors?  
	\item If yes, then pooled OLS is problematic
	\item This is how we motivate a fixed effects model: because we believe unobserved heterogeneity is the main driving force making the treatment variable endogenous
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}

	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Our unobserved effects model is:$$y_{it} = x_{it}\beta + c_i + \varepsilon_{it}; t=1,2,\dots,T$$
	\item If we have data on multiple time periods, we can think of $c_i$ as \textbf{fixed effects} to be estimated
	\item OLS estimation with fixed effects yields$$(\widehat{\beta}, \widehat{c}_1, \dots, \widehat{c}_N) = \underset{b,m_1,\dots,m_N}{\arg\!\min} \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{t=1}^T (y_{it} - x_{it}b - m_i)^2$$this amounts to including $N$ individual dummies in regression of $y_{it}$ on $x_{it}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}
	
$$(\widehat{\beta}, \widehat{c}_1, \dots, \widehat{c}_N) = \underset{b,m_1,\dots,m_N}{\arg\!\min} \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{t=1}^T (y_{it} - x_{it}b - m_i)^2$$

The first-order conditions (FOC) for this minimization problem are: $$\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T x_{it}'(y_{it} - x_{it}\widehat{\beta} - \widehat{c}_i)=0$$ and $$\sum_{t=1}^T(y_{it} - x_{it}\widehat{\beta} - \widehat{c}_i) = 0 $$ for $i=1,\dots,N$.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}
	
Therefore, for $i=1, \dots, N$,$$\widehat{c}_i = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T(y_{it}-x_{it}\widehat{\beta})=\bar{y}_i-\bar{x}_i\widehat{\beta},$$where$$\bar{x}_i \equiv \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^Tx_{it}; \bar{y}_i \equiv \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T y_{it}$$
Plug this result into the first FOC to obtain:$$\widehat{\beta} = \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T (x_{it} - \bar{x}_i)'(x_{it} - \bar{x}_i) \bigg)^{-1} \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T (x_{it} - \bar{x}_i)'(y_{it} - \bar{y})\bigg)$$ $$\widehat{\beta} = \bigg(\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T \ddot{x}_{it}'\ddot{x}_{it} \bigg)^{-1} \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T \ddot{x}_{it}' \ddot{y}_{it} \bigg)$$
with time-demeaned variables $\ddot{x}_{it} \equiv x_{it}-\bar{x},\ddot{y}_{it} \equiv y_{it} - \bar{y}_i$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}
	
Running a regression with the time-demeaned variables $\ddot{y}_{it}\equiv y_{it} - \bar{y}_i$ and $\ddot{x}_{it} \equiv x_{it} - \bar{x}$ is numerically equivalent to a regression of $y_{it}$ on $x_{it}$ and unit specific dummy variables.

\vspace{10mm}

Even better, the regression with the time demeaned variables is consistent for $\beta$ even when $Cov[x_{it},c_i]\neq 0$ because time-demeaning eliminates the unobserved effects

\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{it} &=& x_{it}\beta + c_i + \varepsilon_{it} \\
\bar{y}_i &=& \bar{x}_i \beta + c_i + \bar{\varepsilon}_{i}\\
\hline \\
(y_{it} - \bar{y}_i) &=& (x_{it} - \bar{x})\beta + (c_i - c_i) + (\varepsilon_{it} - \bar{\varepsilon}_i) \\
\ddot{y}_{it} &=& \ddot{x}_{it}\beta + \ddot{\varepsilon}_{it}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Identification assumptions:	
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item $E[\varepsilon_{it} | x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{iT}, c_i]=0; t=1,2,\dots,T$
			\begin{itemize}
			\item regressors are strictly exogenous conditional on the unobserved effect
			\item allows $x_{it}$ to be arbitrarily related to $c_i$
			\end{itemize}
		\item $rank\bigg( \sum_{t=1}^T E[\ddot{x}_{it}'\ddot{x}_{it}]\bigg) = K$
			\begin{itemize}
			\item regressors vary over time for at least some $i$ and not collinear
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Fixed effects estimator
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Demean and regress $\ddot{y}_{it}$ on $\ddot{x}_{it}$ (need to correct degrees of freedom)
		\item Regress $y_{it}$ on $x_{it}$ and unit dummies (dummy variable regression)
		\item Regress $y_{it}$ on $x_{it}$ with canned fixed effects routine
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Stata: \texttt{xtreg y x, fe i(PanelID)}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Properties (under assumptions 1-2):
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $\widehat{\beta}_{FE}$ is consistent: $\underset{N\rightarrow \infty}{plim} \widehat{\beta}_{FE,N}=\beta$
		\item $\widehat{\beta}_{FE}$ is unbiased conditional on \textbf{X}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fixed effects}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Inference:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Standard errors have to be ``clustered'' by panel unit (e.g., farm) to allow correlation in the $\varepsilon_{it}$'s for the same $i$.
		\item Yields valid inference as long as number of clusters is reasonably large
		\end{itemize}	
	\item Typically we care about $\beta$, but unit fixed effects $c_i$ could be of interest
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $\widehat{c}_i$ from dummy variable regression is unbiased but not consistent for $c_i$ (based on fixed $T$ and $N\rightarrow \infty$)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Applications }


\begin{frame}{Application: Survey for Adult Service Providers}

\begin{itemize}
\item From 2008-2009, I fielded a survey of Internet sex workers (685 respondents, 5\% response rate)
\item I asked two types of questions: static provider-specific information (e.g., age, weight) and dynamic session information over last 5 sessions
\item Let's look at the panel aspect of this analysis together
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Returns to risk}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{is} &=& \beta X_i + \delta{D_{is}} + \gamma_{is} Z_{is} + c_i + \varepsilon_{is} \\
\ddot{Y}_{is} &=&  \delta \ddot{D}_{is} +  \gamma_{is} \ddot{Z}_{is} + \ddot \eta_{is}
\end{eqnarray*}where $Y$ is log hourly price (i.e., gross price divided by session length in minutes times 60), $D$ is unprotected sex with a client in session $s$,  $X$ are time invariant observable worker $i$ characteristics, $Z$ are time varying session $s$ characteristics, and $c_i$ is unobserved worker heterogeneity unchanging over time that is correlated with $D_{is}$.

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item This was not a review of panel econometrics; for that see Wooldridge and other excellent options
\item We reviewed POLS and TWFE because they are commonly used with individual level panel data and difference-in-differences
\item Their main value is how they control for unobserved heterogeneity through a simple demeaning while still incorporating time varying covariates
\item Now let's discuss difference-in-differences which will at various times use the TWFE model
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference-in-differences}

Keep in mind that yesterday, we had reviewed OLS used for diff-in-diff with two groups and two time periods

$$Y_{ist} = \alpha + \lambda NJ_s + \gamma d_t + \delta (NJ_s \times d_t) + \varepsilon_{ist}$$

\bigskip

But what if there are more than two treatment groups treated at separate times?  What specification?

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Difference-in-differences}

\begin{itemize}
\item Unclear exactly when it was used, but at some point economists simply began using TWFE with state and year fixed effects and treatment dummy

$$ Y_{ist} = \alpha + \delta D_{st} + \sigma_s + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{ist}$$

\item The hope was that $\widehat{\delta}$ equaled a ``reasonably weighted average'' over all underlying treatment effects and therefore was the ATT
\item Let's look at an example that is prototypical of a traditional DiD using TWFE with multiple treatment groups (five to be precise)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Case study: Castle doctrine reforms}

\begin{itemize}

\item Cheng and Hoekstra (2013) is a good, clean example of a differential timing for us to practice on
\item In 2005, Florida passed a law called Stand Your Ground that expanded self-defense protections beyond the house
\item More ``castle doctrine'' reforms followed from 2006 to 2009

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Description}

Details of castle doctrine reforms
		\begin{itemize}
		\item ``Duty to retreat'' is removed versus castle doctrine reforms; expanded where you can use lethal force
		\item Presumption of reasonable fear is added
		\item Civil liability for those acting under the law is removed
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ambiguous predictions}
	
Castle reforms $\rightarrow$ homicides: Increase by removing homicide penalties and increasing opportunities
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Castle doctrine expansions lowered the (expected) cost of killing someone in self-defense
	\item Lowering the price of lethal self-defense should increase lethal homicides
	\end{itemize}

	\item In original paper, $CDL$ is a fraction between 0 and 1 depending on the percent of the year the state has a castle doctrine law 
	\item Preferred specifications includes ``region-by-year fixed effects'' (see next slide)
	\item Estimation with TWFE and Negative Binomial with and without population weights
	\item Models will include covariates (e.g., police, imprisonment, race shares, state spending on public assistance)

	\item Interpretation is these would not have occurred without castle doctrine reforms
	\item But is this robust to alternative models? Today we will check

\section{TWFE Pathologies}

\begin{frame}{Twoway fixed effects}

\begin{itemize}
\item When working with panel data, the so-called ``twoway fixed effects'' (TWFE) estimator was the workhorse estimator
\item And from the start, it was used with diff-in-diff
\item But at the start, it wasn't staggered adoption -- it was a much simpler design in which a group was treated in one year, and a comparison group wasn't
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two OLS Models}

\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{ist} &=& \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Treat_{is} + \alpha_2 Post_{t} + \delta (Treat_{is} \times Post_t) + \varepsilon_{ist} \\
Y_{ist} &=& \beta_0 + \delta D_{ist} + \tau_t + \sigma_s + \varepsilon_{ist}
\end{eqnarray}

\bigskip

First equation is used for simple designs when everyone is treated at once; second equation was used when different groups were treated at different times (``differential timing'')

\bigskip

First equation works; second one only sometimes works

\end{frame}


\subsection{Potential outcomes}

\begin{frame}{Equivalence}
$$Y_{ist} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Treat_{is} + \alpha_2 Post_{t} + \textcolor{blue}{\delta} (Treat_{is} \times Post_t) + \varepsilon_{ist} $$

\bigskip

$$\widehat{\textcolor{blue}{\delta}} = \bigg ( \overline{y}_k^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_k^{pre(k)} \bigg ) - \bigg ( \overline{y}_U^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_U^{pre(k)} \bigg ) $$

\begin{itemize}
\item Orley claims that the TWFE estimator of $\delta$ and the ``four averages and three subtractions'' are the same thing numerically
\item And they are -- they are numerically \emph{identical}
\item And under a particular assumption, they are also unbiased estimates of an aggregate causal parameter
\item But to see this we need new notation -- potential outcomes
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


















\subsection{Bacon decomposition}

\begin{frame}{Discussion of estimate}


$$Y_{ist} = \beta_0 + \delta D_{ist} + \tau_t + \sigma_s + \varepsilon_{ist}$$


\begin{itemize}
\item So that's the simple case; what about the differential timing case?  

\item If you estimate with OLS with differential timing, what does $\widehat{\delta}$ correspond to?
\item It also corresponds to the previous ``four averages and three subtractions'' -- but it's numerous of them, not just one

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Decomposition Preview}


\begin{itemize}
\item Andrew Goodman-Bacon decomposed $\widehat{\delta}$ and showed it is numerically identical to a weighted average of all ``four averages and three subtractions''
\item But, even before we get to causality there are unusual features
\item TWFE model assigns its own weights which are a function of the size of a ``group'' and the variance of group treatment dummies
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{$K^2$ distinct DDs}

Let's look at 3 timing groups (a, b and c) and one untreated group (U).  With 3 timing groups, there are 9 2x2 DDs.  Here they are:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} &
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} &
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} \\
\midrule
a to b & b to a & c to a \\
a to c & b to c & c to b \\
a to U & b to U & c to U \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

Let's return to a simpler example with only two groups -- a $k$ group treated at $t_k^*$ and an $l$ treated at $t_l^*$ plus an never-treated group called the $U$ untreated group
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{Terms and notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let there be two treatment groups (k,l) and one untreated group (U)
\item k,l define the groups based on when they receive treatment (differently in time) with k receiving it earlier than l
\item Denote $\overline{D}_k$ as the share of time each group spends in treatment status
\item Denote $\widehat{\delta}_{jb}^{2x2}$ as the canonical $2\times 2$ DD estimator for groups $j$ and b where $j$ is the treatment group and $b$ is the comparison group
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bacon decomposition}

$$Y_{ist} = \beta_0 + \delta D_{ist} + \tau_t + \sigma_s + \varepsilon_{ist}$$


TWFE estimate of $\widehat{\delta}$ is equal to a weighted average over all group 2x2 (of which there are 4 in this example)
\begin{eqnarray*}	
\widehat{\delta}^{TWFE} = \sum_{k \neq U} s_{kU}\widehat{\delta}_{kU}^{2x2} + \sum_{k \neq U} \sum_{l>k} s_{kl}  \bigg [ \mu_{kl}\widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{2x2,k} + (1-\mu_{kl}) \widehat{\delta}_{lk}^{2x2,l} \bigg]
\end{eqnarray*}where that first 2x2 combines the k compared to U and the l to U (combined to make the equation shorter)

\end{frame}
	


\begin{frame}{Third, the Weights}

 \begin{eqnarray*} s_{ku} &=& \frac{ n_k n_u \overline{D}_k (1- \overline{D}_k ) }{ \widehat{Var} ( \tilde{D}_{it} )} \\
s_{kl} &=& \frac{ n_k n_l (\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ) ( 1- ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} )) }{\widehat{Var}(\tilde{D}_{it})} \\
\mu_{kl} &=& \frac{1 - \overline{D}_k }{1 - ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} )}
\end{eqnarray*}where $n$ refer to the panel group shares, $\overline{D}_k (1- \overline{D}_k )$, as well as $(\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ) ( 1- ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ))$ expressions refer to variance of treatment, and the final equation is the same for two timing groups.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weights discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two things to note:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item More units in a group, the bigger its 2x2 weight is
	\item Group treatment variance weights up or down a group's 2x2
	\end{itemize}
\item Think about what causes the treatment variance to be as big as possible. Let's think about the $s_{ku}$ weights.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\overline{D}=0.1$. Then $0.1 \times 0.9 = 0.09$
	\item $\overline{D}=0.4$. Then $0.4 \times 0.6 =0.24$
	\item $\overline{D}=0.5$. Then $0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25$
	\item $\overline{D}=0.6$. Then $0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.24$
	\end{itemize}
\item This means the weight on treatment variance is maximized for \emph{groups treated in middle of the panel}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More weights discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item But what about the ``treated on treated'' weights (i.e., $\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} $)  
\item Same principle as before - when the difference between treatment variance is close to 0.5, those 2x2s are given the greatest weight
\item For instance, say $t^*_k=0.15$ and $t^*_l=0.67$. Then $\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} = 0.52$.  And thus $0.52 \times 0.48 = 0.2496$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Summarizing TWFE centralities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Groups in the middle of the panel weight up their respective 2x2s via the variance weighting
\item Decomposition highlights the strange role of panel length when using TWFE
\item Different choices about panel length change both the 2x2 and the weights based on variance of treatment
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Back to TWFE}


$$Y_{ist} = \beta_0 + \delta D_{ist} + \tau_t + \sigma_s + \varepsilon_{ist}$$


\begin{itemize}

\item So we know that the estimate is a weighted average over all ``four averages and three subtractions'' but is that good or bad?
\item It's good if it's unbiased; it's bad if it isn't, and the decomposition doesn't tell us which unless we replace realized outcomes with potential outcomes
\item Bacon shows that TWFE estimate of $\delta$ needs two assumptions for unbiasedness:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item variance weighted parallel trends are zero and 
	\item no dynamic treatment effects (not the case with 2x2)
	\end{enumerate}
\item Under those assumptions, TWFE estimator estimates the variance weighted ATT as a weighted average of all possible ATTs (not just weighted average of DiDs)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Moving from 2x2s to causal effects and bias terms}

Let's start breaking down these estimators into their corresponding estimation objects expressed in causal effects and biases


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kU} &=& ATT_k{Post} + \Delta Y^0_k(Post(k),Pre(k)) - \Delta Y^0_U(Post(k),Pre) \\
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kl} &=& ATT_k(MID) + \Delta Y^0_k(MID,Pre) - \Delta Y^0_l(MID, Pre)
\end{eqnarray*}These look the same because you're always comparing the treated unit with an untreated unit (though in the second case it's just that they haven't been treated \emph{yet}). 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The dangerous 2x2}

But what about the 2x2 that compared the late groups to the already-treated earlier groups? With a lot of substitutions we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{lk} &=& ATT_{l,Post(l)} + \underbrace{\Delta Y^0_l(Post(l),MID) - \Delta Y^0_k ( Post(l), MID)}_{\mathclap{\text{Parallel trends bias}}} \\
&& - \underbrace{(ATT_k(Post) - ATT_k(Mid))}_{\mathclap{\text{Heterogeneity bias!}}}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notice the number of assumptions needed \emph{even} to estimate this very strange weighted ATT (which is a function of how you drew the panel in the first place). 
\item With dynamics, it attenuates the estimate (bias) and can even reverse sign depending on the magnitudes of what is otherwise effects in the sign in a reinforcing direction! 
\item Model can flip signs (does not satisfy a ``no sign flip property'')

\section{Aggregating building blocks}

\subsection{CS}



\begin{frame}{Callaway and Sant'Anna 2020}

CS is a DiD estimator used for estimating and then summarizing smaller ATT parameters under differential timing and conditional parallel trends into more policy relevant ATT parameters (either dynamic or static)


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./lecture_includes/pedro_cites}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{When is CS used}

Just some examples of when you'd want to consider it:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When treatment effects differ depending on when it was adopted
\item When treatment effects change over time
\item When shortrun treatment effects are different than longrun effects
\item When treatment effect dynamics differ if people are first treated in a recession relative to expansion years
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

CS estimates the ATT by identifying smaller causal effects and aggregating them using non-negative weights

\end{frame}






\begin{frame}{Group-time ATT}
       \begin{columns}
          \column{0.38\linewidth}
             \centering
             \includegraphics[height=6.5cm, width=5.5cm]{./lecture_includes/baker_attgt}
           \column{0.38\linewidth}
            Each cell contains that group's ATT(g,t)
\begin{eqnarray*}
ATT(g,t) = E[Y_t^1 - Y_t^0 | G_g=1]
\end{eqnarray*}CS identifies all feasible ATT(g,t)
         \end{columns} 
    \end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Group-time ATT}

Group-time ATT is the ATT for a specific group and time
\begin{itemize}
\item Groups are basically cohorts of units treated at the same time
\item Group-time ATT estimates are simple (weighted) differences in means
\item Does not directly restrict heterogeneity with respect to observed covariates, timing or the evolution of treatment effects over time
\item Allows us ways to choose our aggregations
\item Inference is the bootstrap
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ periods going from $t=1, \dots, T$
\item Units are either treated ($D_t=1$) or untreated ($D_t=0$) but once treated cannot revert to untreated state
\item $G_g$ signifies a group and is binary.  Equals one if individual units are treated at time period $t$.
\item $C$ is also binary and indicates a control group unit equalling one if ``never treated'' (can be relaxed though to ``not yet treated'')
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Recall the problem with TWFE on using treatment units as controls
	\end{itemize}
\item Generalized propensity score enters into the estimator as a weight: $$\widehat{p(X)} = Pr(G_g=1 | X,G_g+C=1)$$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}

Assumption 1: Sampling is iid (panel data, but repeated cross-sections are possible) \\
\bigskip
Assumption 2: Conditional parallel trends (for either never treated or not yet treated) \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y_t^0 - Y_{t-1}^0 | X,G_g=1] = [Y_t^0 - Y_{t-1}^0 | X,C=1] 
\end{eqnarray*}
\bigskip
Assumption 3: Irreversible treatment \\
Assumption 4: Common support (propensity score) \\
\bigskip
Assumption 5: Limited treatment anticipation (i.e., treatment effects are zero pre-treatment)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{CS Estimator (the IPW version)}

\begin{eqnarray*}
ATT(g,t) = E \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac{G_g}{E[G_g]} - \frac{ \frac{\hat{p}(X)C}{1-\hat{p}(X)}}{E \bigg [ \frac{\hat{p}(X)C}{1-\hat{p}(X)} \bigg ]} \bigg ) (Y_t - Y_{g-1} ) \bigg ) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

This is the inverse probability weighting estimator.  Alternatively, there is an outcome regression approach and a doubly robust. Sant'Anna recommends DR.  CS uses the never-treated or the not-yet-treated as controls but never the already-treated 
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Aggregated vs single year/group ATT}

\begin{itemize}
\item The method they propose is really just identifying very narrow ATT per group time.
\item But we are often interested in  more aggregate parameters, like the ATT across all groups and all times
\item They present two alternative methods for building ``interesting parameters'' 
\item Inference from a bootstrap
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Group-time ATT }
             \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{./lecture_includes/baker_attgt_cs}

TWFE is no longer negative, interestingly, once we eliminate the last group (giving us a never-treated group), but is still suffering from attenuation bias.

\subsection{SA}

\begin{frame}{Event study and differential timing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes we care about a simple summary, and sometimes we care about separating it out in time and sometimes in even more interesting ways
\item Event studies with one treatment group and one untreated group were relatively straightforward
\item Interact treatment group with calendar date to get a series of leads and lags
\item But when there are more than one treatment group, specification challenges emerge
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Bias of TWFE Event Study Specificaiton}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bacon only focused on the static specification, and that's where the biases due to dynamics revealed itself
\item He was unable to get into the leads and lags using the FWL method he was using (``it's hard!'' - Bacon)
\item Sophie Sun and Sarah Abraham did though -- prompted by a stray comment by their professor
\item But they also unlike Bacon present a solution (which is like CS, but discovered independently)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Sun and Abraham 2020}

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item SA shows a decomposition of the population regression coefficient on event study leads and lags with differential timing estimated with TWFE
	\item They show that the population regression coefficient is ``contaminated'' by information from other leads and lags (which is then later generalized by Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hull and Kolsar 2022)
	\item SA presents an alternative estimator that is a version of CS only using the ``last cohort'' as the treatment group (not the not-yet-treated)
	\item Derives the variance of the estimator instead of bootstrapping, handles covariates differently than CS, but otherwise identical
	\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summarizing (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Under homogenous treatment profiles, weights sum to zero and ``cancel out'' the treatment effects from other periods 
\item Under treatment effect heterogeneity, they do not cancel out and leads and lags are biased
\item They present a 3-step TWFE based alternative estimator which addresses the problems that they find
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Some notation and terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item As people often \textbf{bin} the data, we allow a lead or lag $l$ to appear in bin $g$ so sometimes they use $g$ instead of $l$ or $l \in g$
\item Building block is the ``cohort-specific ATT'' or $CATT_{e,l}$ -- same as ATT(g,t)
\item Our goal is to estimate $CATT_{e,l}$ with population regression coefficient $\mu_l$
\item They focus on irreversible treatment where treatment status is non-decreasing sequence of zeroes and ones
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Difficult notation (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\infty$ symbol is used to either describe the group ($E_i=\infty$) or the potential outcome ($Y^{\infty}$)
\item $Y^{\infty}_{i,t}$ is is the potential outcome for unit $i$ if it had never received treatment (versus received it later), also called the baseline outcome
\item Other counterfactuals are possible -- maybe unit $i$ isn't ``never treated'' but treated later in counterfactual
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More difficult notation (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Treatment effects are the difference between the observed outcome relative to the never-treated counterfactual outcome: $Y_{i,t} - Y^{\infty}_{i,t}$
\item We can take the average of treatment effects at a given relative time period across units first treated at time $E_i=e$ (same cohort) which is what we mean by $CATT_{e,l}$
\item Doesn't use $t$ index time (``calendar time''), rather uses $l$ which is time until or time after treatment date $e$ (``relative time'')
\item Think of it as ${l}=$year - treatment date
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Relative vs calendar event time}


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{./lecture_includes/timetil}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Definition 1}

\textbf{Definition 1:} The cohort-specific ATT $l$ periods from initial treatment date $e$ is:

\begin{eqnarray*}
CATT_{e,l} = E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l} | E_i=e]
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Fill out the second part of the Group-time ATT exercise together.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TWFE assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item For consistent estimates of the coefficient leads and lags using TWFE model, we need three assumptions
\item For SA and CS, we only need two
\item Let's look then at the three
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 1: Parallel trends}

\textbf{Assumption 1: Parallel trends in baseline outcomes}: $E[Y^{\infty}_{i,t} - Y^{\infty}_{i,s} | E_i = e ]$ is the same for all $e \in supp(E_i)$ and for all $s$, $t$ and is equal to $E[Y^{\infty}_{i,t} - Y^{\infty}_{i,s} ]$

\bigskip

Lead and lag coefficients are DiD equations but once we invoke parallel trends they can become causal parameters.  This reminds us again how crucial it is to have  appropriate controls

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 2: No anticipation}

\textbf{Assumption 2: No anticipator behavior in pre-treatment periods}: There is a set of pre-treatment periods such that $E[Y_{i,e+l}^e - Y_{i,e+l}^{\infty} | E_i = e]=0$ for all possible leads.

\bigskip

Essentially means that pre-treatment, the causal effect is zero.  Most plausible if no one sees the treatment coming, but even if they see it coming, they may not be able to make adjustments that affect outcomes

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 3: Homogeneity}

\textbf{Assumption 3: Treatment effect profile homogeneity}: For each relative time period $l$, the $CATT_{e,l}$ doesn't depend on the cohort and is equal to $CATT_l$. 


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Treatment effect heterogeneity}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumption 3 is violated when different cohorts experience different paths of treatment effects
\item Cohorts may differ in their covariates which affect how they respond to treatment (e.g., if treatment effects vary with age, and there is variation in age across units first treated at different times, then there will be heterogeneous treatment effects)
\item Doesn't rule out parallel trends
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Event study model}

Dynamic TWFE model

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_t + \sum_{g \in G} \mu_g1\{t-E_i \in g \} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

We are interested in the properties of $\mu_g$ under differential timing as well as whether there are any never-treated units

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[plain, shrink=20]
\begin{center}
\textbf{Interpreting $\widehat{\mu_g}$ under no to all assumptions}
\end{center}

\textbf{Proposition 1 (no assumptions):} The population regression coefficient on relative period bin $g$ is a linear combination of differences in trends from its own relative period $l \in g$, from relative periods $l \in g'$ of other bins $g' \neq g$, and from relative periods excluded from the specification (e.g., trimming). 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \underbrace{\sum_{l \in g} \sum_{e} w^g_{e,l} \big ( E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,0} | E_i = e] - E[Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,0}] \big )}_{\mathclap{\text{Targets}}} \\

\begin{frame}{Weight ($w^g_{e,l}$) summation cheat sheet}

\item For relative periods belonging to some other bin $l\in g'$ and $g' \neq g$, t $\sum_{l \in g'}\sum_ew^g_{e,l} = 0$
\item For relative periods not included in $G$, $\sum_{l \in g^{excl}} \sum_e w^g_{e,l} = -1$

\item $\{ 1\{ t-E_i \in g \} \}_{g \in G}$(i.e., leads and lags) and 
\item the unit and time fixed effects
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Still biased under parallel trends}

\textbf{Proposition 2}: Under the parallel trends only, the population regression coefficient on the indicator for relative period bing $g$ is a linear combination of $CATT_{e,l \in g}$ as well as $CATT_{d,l'}$ from other relative periods $l' \notin g$ with the same weights stated in Proposition 1:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \underbrace{\sum_{l \in g} \sum_e w^g_{e,l} CATT_{e,l}}_{\mathclap{\text{Desirable}}} \\
&& + \underbrace{\sum_{g' \neq g, g' \in G} \sum_{l' \in g'} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'}  CATT_{e,l'}}_{\mathclap{\text{Bias from other specified bins}}} \\
&&+ \underbrace{\sum_{l' \in g^{excl}} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'} CATT_{e,l'}}_{\mathclap{\text{Bias from dropped relative time indicators}}}
\end{eqnarray*}



\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Still biased under parallel trends and no anticipation}

\textbf{Proposition 3}: If parallel trends holds and no anticipation holds for all $l<0$ (i.e., no anticipatory behavior pre-treatment), then the population regression coefficient $\mu_g$ for $g$ is a linear combination of post-treatment $CATT_{e,l'}$ for all $l' \geq 0$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \sum_{l' \in g, l' \geq 0} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'} CATT_{e,l'} \\
&&+ \sum_{g' \neq g,g' \in G} \sum_{l' \in g', l' \geq 0} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'} CATT_{e,l'} \\
&&+ \sum_{l' \in g^{excl},l' \geq 0} \sum_e w^g_{w,l'} CATT_{e,l'}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proposition 3 comment}

Notice how once we impose zero pre-treatment treatment effects, those terms are gone (i.e., no $l \in g, l<0$).  But the second term remains unless we impose treatment effect homogeneity (homogeneity causes terms due to weights summing to zero to cancel out). Thus $\mu_g$ may be non-zero for pre-treatment periods \emph{even though parallel trends hold in the pre period.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proposition 4}

\textbf{Proposition 4}: If parallel trends and treatment effect homogeneity, then $CATT_{e,l}=ATT_l$ is constant across $e$ for a given $l$, and the population regression coefficient $\mu_g$ is equal to a linear combination of $ATT_{l \in g}$, as well as $ATT_{l' \notin g}$ from other relative periods

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \sum_{l \in g} w^g_l ATT_l \\
&&+ \sum_{g' \neq g} \sum_{l' \in g'} w^g_{l'} ATT_{l'} \\
&&+ \sum_{l' \in g^{excl}} w^g_{l'}ATT_{l'}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simple example}


Balanced panel $T=2$ with cohorts $E_i \in \{1,2 \}$. For illustrative purposes, we will include bins $\{-2,0\}$ in our calculations but drop $\{-1,1\}$. 


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simple example}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_{-2} &=& \underbrace{CATT_{2,-2}}_{\mathclap{\text{own period}}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}CATT_{1,0} - \frac{1}{2} CATT_{2,0}}_{\mathclap{\text{other included bins}}} \\
&&+ \underbrace{ \frac{1}{2} CATT_{1,1} - CATT_{1,-1} - \frac{1}{2} CATT_{2,-1} }_{\mathclap{\text{Excluded bins}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends gets us to all of the $CATT$
\item No anticipation makes $CATT=0$ for all $l<0$ (all $l<0$ cancel out)
\item Homogeneity cancels second and third terms
\item Still leaves $\frac{1}{2} CATT_{1,1}$ -- you chose  to exclude a group with a treatment effect
\end{itemize}Lesson: drop the relative time indicators on the left, not things on the right, bc lagged effects will contaminate through the excluded bins


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Robust event study estimation}


\begin{itemize}
\item All the robust estimators under differential timing have solutions and they all skip over forbidden contrasts. 
\item Sun and Abraham (2020) propose a 3-step interacted weighted estimator (IW) using last treated group as control group
\item Callaway and Sant'anna (2020) estimate group-time ATT which can be a weighted average over relative time periods too but uses ``not-yet-treated'' as control
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Interaction-weighted estimator}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Step one}: Do this DD regression and hold on to $\widehat{\delta}_{e,l}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{e \notin C} \sum_{l \neq -1} \delta_{e,l} \big (1 \{ E_i = e \} \cdot D_{i,t}^l \big ) + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray*}


\bigskip

Can use never-treated or last-treated cohort. Drop always treated. The $\delta_{e,l}$ is a DD estimator for $CATT_{e,l}$ with particular choices for pre-period and cohort controls

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Interaction-weighted estimator}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Step two}: Estimate weights using sample shares of each cohort in the relevant periods:
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr(E_i=e|E_i \in [-l,T-l])
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interaction-weighted estimator}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Step three}: Take a weighted average of estimates for $CATT_{e,l}$ from Step 1 with weight estimates from step 2
\end{itemize}


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{v}_g = \frac{1}{|g|} \sum_{l \in g} \sum_e \widehat{\delta}_{e,l} \widehat{Pr} \{ E_i=e | E_i \in [-l,T-l]\}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Consistency and Inference}


\begin{itemize}
\item Under parallel trends and no anticipation, $\widehat{\delta}_{e,l}$ is consistent, and sample shares are also consistent estimators for population shares. 
\item Thus IW estimator is consistent for a weighted average of $CATT_{e,l}$ with weights equal to the share of each cohort in the relevant period(s).
\item They show that each IW estimator is asymptotically normal and derive its asymptotic variance. Doesn't rely on bootstrap like CS.

\begin{frame}{DD Estimator of CATT}

\textbf{Definition 2}: DD estimator with pre-period $s$ and control cohorts $C$ estimates $CATT_{e,l}$ as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta_{e,l}} = \frac{ E_N \big [ \big ( Y_{i, e+l} - Y_{i,s} \big ) \times 1\{E_i=e\} \big ]}{E_N[1 \{E_i=e\} ]} - \frac{E_N \big [ \big ( Y_{i,e+l} \times 1 \{E_i \in C \} ]}{E_N [1 \{ E_i \in C \}]}
\end{eqnarray*}


\textbf{Proposition 5}: If parallel trends and no anticipation both hold for all pre-periods, then the DD estimator using any pre-period and non-empty control cohorts (never-treated or not-yet-treated) is an unbiased estimate for $CATT_{e,l}$

\subsection{dCH}

\begin{frame}{de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeulle 2020}

de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfouelle 2020 (dCdH) is different from the other papers in several ways
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Like SA, it's a diagnosis and a cure
	\item TWFE decomposition shows coefficient a weighted average of underlying treatment effects, but weights can be negative negating causal interpretation
	\item Propose a solution for both static and dynamic specification which does not use already treated as controls
	\item Treatment can turn on and off
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Comment on Bacon}

\begin{itemize}
\item Recall the Bacon decomposition -- TWFE coefficients are decomposed into weighted average of all underlying 2x2s. Weights were non-negative and summed to one.
\item But this decomposition was more a numerical decomposition -- what exactly adds up to equal the TWFE coefficient using the data we observe?
\item Bacon's decomposition is not ``theoretical'' -- not in the way that other decompositions are. He is just explaining what OLS ``does'' when it calculates $\widehat{\delta}$
\item Just explains what comparisons OLS is using to calculate the TWFE coefficient -- just peels back the curtain.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Negative weights}

\begin{itemize}
\item dCdH impose causal assumptions and try a different decomposition strategy
\item Uses as its building block the unit-specific treatment effects
\item Their decomposition will reveal negative weights on the underlying treatment effects (similar to negative weight on dynamics with Bacon)
\item Remember though: the Bacon decomposition weights were \emph{always} positive, because they were numerical weights (not theoretical weights) on the underlying 2x2s (not the treatment effects)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Turning on and off}

\begin{itemize}
\item CS and SA both require interventions to turn on and stay on
\item dCdH allows for ``switching'' on and off 
\item Before we move quickly into that, please note that the researcher bears the burden of knowing whether in fact you want to impose symmetry on turning on and off
\item Roe v Wade ``turned on'' legalized abortion and 2022 it was ``turned off'' -- do we want to treat these as simply a single policy flipping of the switch or two separate policies?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dCdH notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual treatment effects (iow, not the group-time ATT): $$\Delta^g_{i,t} = Y^1_{i,t} - Y^\infty_{i,t}$$ but where the treatment is in time period $g$. Notice --it's not the ATT (it's $i$ individual treatment effect)
\item with defined error term as $\varepsilon_{i,t}$: $$D_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$
\item Weights: $$w_{i,t} = \frac{\varepsilon_{i,t}}{\frac{1}{N^T} \sum_{i,t:D_{i,t}=1} \varepsilon_{i,t}}$$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Parallel trend assumption}

\begin{block}{Strong unconditional PT}
Assume that for every time period $t$ and every group $g,g'$, $$E[Y^\infty_t - Y^\infty_{t-1}|G=g] = E[Y^\infty_t - Y^\infty_{t-1}|G=g'] $$
\end{block}Assume parallel trends for every unit in every cohort in every time period.

\bigskip

What then does TWFE estimate with differential timing?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dCdH Theorem}

\begin{block}{Theorem -- dCdH decomposition}
Assuming SUTVA, no anticipation and the strong PT, then let $\delta$ be the TWFE estimand associated with $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \delta D_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$Then it follows that $$\delta = E \bigg [ \sum_{i,t:D_{i,t}=1} \frac{1}{N^T} w_{i,t} \cdot \Delta_{i,t}^g \bigg ] $$ where $\sum_{i,t:D_{i,t}=1} \frac{w_{i,t}}{N^T} = 1$ but $w_{i,t}$ can be negative
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Origins}

\begin{itemize}
\item So once you run that specification, $\widehat{\delta}$ is going to recover a ``non-convex average'' over all unit level treatment effects (weights can be negative, more on this). 
\item Not sure who came first, because there were working papers before publications, but my understanding is dCdH was the first to prove this
\item Very important theorem -- established the ``no sign flip property'' for OLS with differential timing in the canonical static specification
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Negative weights}

\begin{itemize}
\item Very common now to hear about negative weights, and furthermore, that negative weights wipe out any causal interpretation, but why?
\item Thought experiment: imagine every unit gained from the treatment, but their treatment effect when estimated was multiplied by a negative number
\item It's possible it could flip the sign, but it would definitely at least pull the estimate away from the true effect
\item This is dangerous -- and it's caused by the forbidden contrasts (comparing treated to already treated) which is what the canonical TWFE static specification is doing (for many of us unknowingly)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Negative weights}

\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't always pose a problem, but no proofs for this intuition known yet
\item A large number of never-treated seems to make this less an issue
\item Shrinking the spacing between treatment dates also can drive it down
\item But does that mean that TWFE works, and what does it mean to work?
\item TWFE still even when all the weights are positive the weighted average may not aggregate to what we think it does
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weighting}

\begin{itemize}
\item The weights in OLS all come out of the model itself, \emph{not the economic question}
\item The economic question is ``what parameter do you want? What does it look like? Who is in it?''
\item And when you define the parameter up front, you've more or less defined the economic question you're asking
\item But OLS sort of ignores your question and just gives you what it wants
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weighting}

\begin{itemize}
\item What makes something a good vs a bad weight?
\item Not being negative is the absolute minimal requirement
\item But it's also not a good sign if you can't really explain the weights
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dCdH Solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item dCdH propose an alternative that doesn't have the problems of TWFE -- both avoiding negative weights and improving interpretability
\item Their model can handle reversible treatments, but in the context of differential timing is equivalent to CS and SA with a particular choice of weights
\item For diagnostic purposes, they recommend reporting the number/fraction of group-time ATTs that receive negative weights, as well as the degree of heterogeneity in treatment eﬀects that would be necessary for the estimated treatment eﬀect to have the “wrong sign"

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\section{Short-gap vs Long-Difference Calculations in Event Studies}



\begin{frame}{Different ways}

\begin{itemize}

\item In CS and dCDH, there are two ways to calculate the pre-treatment coefficients once you have obtained the ATT(g,t) parameter estimates:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Short gap}. Uses a "rolling" method in which a new baseline is used for each 2x2 comparison.
	
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	 \widehat{\delta}_{t-3} = \left( E[Y|D=1, t-3] - E[Y|D=1, t-2] \right) \\
	 - \left( E[Y|D=0, t-3] - E[Y|D=0, t-2] \right)
	 \end{eqnarray*}
	 
	\item \textbf{Long difference}. Uses a "universal baseline" with a fixed baseline at \( t-1 \).
	
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	 \widehat{\delta}_{t-3} = \left( E[Y|D=1, t-3] - E[Y|D=1, t-1] \right) \\
	 - \left( E[Y|D=0, t-3] - E[Y|D=0, t-1] \right)
	 \end{eqnarray*}

	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TWFE, Imputation, and CS}

TWFE and imputation methods (discussed next) always use a fixed universal baseline. To ensure comparability with CS or dCDH, be sure to use the universal baseline syntax in Stata, R, or Python.

\begin{frame}{Recommendations}

\begin{quote}
"A natural follow-up question is to what extent the event-study plots for these alternative methods can be modified to be more comparable to conventional event-study plots. For CS/dCDH, there is a straightforward solution, which is to use “long-diﬀerences” for the pre-treatment coeﬃcients as well as the post-treatment coeﬃcients (i.e. always use the period before treatment as the baseline). This can be implemented, for example, in the \texttt{did} R and Stata packages using the options $\texttt{base_period = “universal”}$ and \texttt{long2}, respectively.  Using the default options in the \texttt{did_multiplegt} Stata package also yields comparisons using “long diﬀerences”, in contrast to the results for the R package shown above. Using these settings, the event-study estimates are numerically equivalent to the dynamic TWFE specification in the non-staggered setting considered here." - Roth (2024)

\begin{frame}{Warning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Unfortunately the \textcolor{red}{default} syntax for \texttt{csdid} and \texttt{did} in R uses short-gap
\item So you \emph{must} use \texttt{long2} or \texttt{base_period = universal} to get the event study coefficient that will correctly illustrate the pre-treatment coefficients
\item In addition to Roth (2024), Brantly Callaway has a note on his website about it \url{https://bcallaway11.github.io/posts/event-study-universal-v-varying-base-period}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

\item The previous methods are fairly comparable, but note, these models all assume parallel trends or conditional parallel trends
\item Question is which \emph{comparison group} is more sensible to use -- the never-treated or the not-yet-treated?
\item There is no single answer to that -- the more the treatment was quasi-random, the more the never-treated is appealing
\item But maybe the not-yet-treated is better as why didn't the never-treated adopt the treatment?  
\item Don't get lost in the decisions and forget the importance of \emph{designing}, focus on treatment assignment mechanism, checking imbalance

\end{itemize}
