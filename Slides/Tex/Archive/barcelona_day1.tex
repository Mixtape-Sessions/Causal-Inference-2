\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Managing expectations}


\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introducing myself: Scott Cunningham (Baylor)
\item Welcome to Mixtape Sessions workshop on advanced difference-in-differences and synthetic control
\item 09:00am to 18:00pm, 15 min breaks every hour, 1 hour lunch
\item Lecture, discussion, exercises, application
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What my pedagogy is like}

\begin{itemize}
\item Long days that don't feel long because it's high energy, with regular breaks including lunch
\item Move between the econometrics, history of thought, videos, applications, code, spreadsheets, exercises
\item Ask questions at any point; I'll do my best to answer them
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Class goals}
Pedagogical goal is to break down the procedures into plain English, rebuilding it into something you can and want to use, but also:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Confidence}: You will feel like you have a good enough understanding of diff-in-diff and synthetic control, both in its basics and some more contemporary issues, so that by the end of the week it a very intuitive, friendly, and useful tool
    \item \textbf{Comprehension}: You will have learned a lot both conceptually and in the specifics, particularly with regards to issues around identification and estimation in the diff-in-diff and synth context
    \item \textbf{Competency}: You will have more knowledge of programming syntax in Stata and R so that later you can apply this in your own work
  \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Introducing difference-in-differences}



\begin{frame}{What is difference-in-differences (DiD)}

\begin{itemize}
\item DiD is a very old, relatively straightforward, intuitive research design
\item A group of units are assigned some treatment and then compared to a group of units that weren't
\item One of the most widely used quasi-experimental methods in economics and increasingly in industry
\item Mostly associated with ``big shocks'' happening in space over time
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference-in-differences and empirical crisis in labor economics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Empirical crisis in empirical labor back in the 1970s (26:31 to 32:00)  \\ \url{https://youtu.be/1soLdywFb_Q?t=1579}
\item Orley Ashenfelter graduated from Princeton in the 1970s, takes a job in Washington DC and begins studying ``job trainings programs'' where he develops the difference-in-differences design

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Explaining diff-in-diff}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most of us grew up on diff-in-diff being a regression
\item And so did Orley -- but listen to how the constraints of communicating results led to a new explanation (2:06 to 3:30)
\end{itemize}
 \url{https://youtu.be/WnB3EJ8K7lg?t=126}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Potential outcomes}

\begin{frame}{Equivalence}
$$Y_{ist} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Treat_{is} + \alpha_2 Post_{t} + \textcolor{blue}{\delta} (Treat_{is} \times Post_t) + \varepsilon_{ist} $$

\bigskip

$$\widehat{\textcolor{blue}{\delta}} = \bigg ( \overline{y}_k^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_k^{pre(k)} \bigg ) - \bigg ( \overline{y}_U^{post(k)} - \overline{y}_U^{pre(k)} \bigg ) $$

\begin{itemize}
\item Orley claims that the OLS estimator of $\delta$ and the ``four averages and three subtractions'' are the same thing numerically
\item And they are -- they are numerically \emph{identical}
\item And under a particular assumption, they are also unbiased estimates of an aggregate causal parameter
\item But to see this we need new notation -- potential outcomes
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes notation}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Let the treatment be a binary variable: $$D_{i,t} =\begin{cases} 1 \text{ if in job training program $t$} \\ 0 \text{ if not in job training program at time $t$} \end{cases}$$where $i$ indexes an individual observation, such as a person

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes notation}
	
	\begin{itemize}

	\item Potential outcomes: $$Y_{i,t}^j =\begin{cases} 1 \text{: wages at time $t$ if trained} \\ 0 \text{: wages at time $t$ if not trained} \end{cases}$$where $j$ indexes a counterfactual state of the world

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Treatment effect definitions}


	\begin{block}{Individual treatment effect}
	    The individual treatment effect,  $\delta_i$, equals $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$
	\end{block}

Missing data problem:  I don't know my own counterfactual
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Conditional Average Treatment Effects}	
	\begin{block}{Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)}
	The average treatment effect on the treatment group is equal to the average treatment effect conditional on being a treatment group member:
		\begin{eqnarray*}
		E[\delta|D=1]&=&E[Y^1-Y^0|D=1] \nonumber \\
		&=&E[Y^1|D=1]-\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0|D=1]}
		\end{eqnarray*}
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip

This is one of the most important policy parameters, if not the most important, and coincidentally it's also the parameter you get with diff-in-diff (even with heterogeneity)

	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes vs data}

\begin{itemize}
\item ATT is expressed in terms of potential outcomes, but we do not use potential outcomes for estimation; we use data
\item Potential outcomes are unknown and \emph{hypothetical} possibilities describing states of the world but our data are realized outcomes, or ``data'', that actually occurred
\item Potential outcomes become realized under treatment assignment $$Y_{it}=D_{it}Y_{it}^1 + (1-D_{it})Y_{it}^0$$
\item Depending on how the treatment is assigned really dictates whether correlations reveal causal effects or bias

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Steps of a project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert research question into causal parameter -- for DiD that is the ATT \emph{and only the ATT}
\item Deduce beliefs needed to estimate that causal parameter with data -- ?
\item Create a calculator that will use data and estimate the causal parameter -- ?
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Most of us skipped (1) and maybe even (2) and instead simply ``ran regressions'' and cross our fingers that that coefficient is causal, but is it? And why is it?  And what is it?  

\end{frame}


\subsection{Identification and Estimation}


\begin{frame}{DiD equation}

Orley's ``four averages and three subtractions'', or what Bacon will call the 2x2

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} = \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}$k$ are the people in the job training program, $U$ are the untreated people not in the program, $Post$ is after the trainees took the class, $Pre$ is the period just before they took the class, and $E[y]$ is mean earnings. 

\bigskip

Does $\widehat{\delta}$ equal the ATT?  If so when? If not why not?

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Potential outcomes and the switching equation}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( \underbrace{E[Y^1_k|Post] - E[Y^0_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^0_U | Post ] - E[ Y^0_U | Pre]}_{\mathclap{\text{Switching equation}}} \bigg)  \\
&&+ \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y_k^0 |Post] - E[Y^0_k | Post]}}_{\mathclap{\text{Adding zero}}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Parallel trends bias}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \underbrace{E[Y^1_k | Post] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k | Post]}}_{\mathclap{\text{ATT}}} \\
&& + \bigg [  \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k | Post]} - E[Y^0_k | Pre] \bigg ] - \bigg [ E[Y^0_U | Post] - E[Y_U^0 | Pre] }_{\mathclap{\text{Non-parallel trends bias in 2x2 case}}} \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification through parallel trends}
	

	\begin{block}{Parallel trends}
	Assume two groups, treated and comparison group, then we define parallel trends as:	 $$\textcolor{red}{E(}\textcolor{red}{\Delta Y^0_k)} = E(\Delta Y^0_U)$$
	\end{block}

\textbf{In words}: ``The \textcolor{red}{evolution of earnings for our trainees \emph{had they not trained}} is the same as the evolution of mean earnings for non-trainees''.  

\bigskip

It's in \textcolor{red}{red} because parallel trends is untestable and critically important to estimation of the ATT using any method, OLS or ``four averages and three subtractions''


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Steps of a project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert research question into causal parameter -- for DiD that is the ATT
\item Deduce beliefs needed to estimate that causal parameter with data -- Parallel trends, No Anticipation, SUTVA
\item Create a calculator that will use data and estimate the causal parameter -- Four averages and three subtractions
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}

	

	


\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}What if our control group was treated in both periods.  Replace expectations with potential outcomes and rewrite using the ``add zero'' trick we did.  How is this similar to what we did before?  Is parallel trends enough?


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}

Switching equation  (notice the 1's in the comparison group)
\\

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y^1_k|Post] - E[Y^0_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^1_U | Post ] - E[ Y^1_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y^1_k|Post] - E[Y^0_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^1_U | Post ] - E[ Y^1_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
&& + \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post] - E[Y(0)_k|Post]}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now let's rearrange and do our trick and see if this becomes the DID.


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=&   \underbrace{E[Y^1_k|Post] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post]}}_{\mathclap{ATT}}  \\
&&+ \bigg ( \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post]} - E[Y^0_k|Pre]  \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^1_U | Post ] - E[ Y^1_U | Pre]}_{\mathclap{\text{Not parallel trends}}} \bigg ) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Ah.  So that's the problem with using treated units as controls -- the DiD equation isn't collapsing to ATT+PT.  So what is it collapsing to?


\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}

Let's add these zeroes:

\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_{U} | Post] - E[Y^0_{U} | Post]} = 0 \\
&&\textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_{U} | Pre] - E[Y^0_{U} | Pre]} = 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=&   \underbrace{E[Y^1_k|Post] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post]}}_{\mathclap{ATT}}  \\
&&+ \bigg ( \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post]} - E[Y^0_k | Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg (\textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Post ]} - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Pre ] }}_{\mathclap{\text{Non parallel trends bias}}} \bigg ) \\
&&+ \bigg (E[Y^1_U | Post ]  - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Post ]} \bigg ) - \bigg   (E[Y^1_U | Pre ]  - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Pre ]} \bigg )
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=&   \underbrace{E[Y^1_k|Post] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post]}}_{\mathclap{ATT}}  \\
&&+ \bigg ( \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_k|Post]} - E[Y^0_k | Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg (\textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Post ]} - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Pre ] }}_{\mathclap{\text{Non parallel trends bias}}} \bigg ) \\
&&+ \bigg ( \underbrace{E[Y^1_U | Post ]  - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Post]}}_{\mathclap{ATT_{Post}}}  \bigg ) - \bigg   ( \underbrace{E[Y^1_U | Pre ]  - \textcolor{blue}{E[Y^0_U | Pre ]}}_{\mathclap{ATT_{Pre}}} \bigg )
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}

We can simplify this:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} =   ATT + PT - \Delta ATT
\end{eqnarray*}

Make a distinction between the real DiD and the counterfeit DiD.  Real DiD only makes assumptions about $E[Y^0]$, but counterfeit DiD make assumptions about $E[Y^0]$ \emph{and} treatment effects. And yes you find this in Goodman-Bacon (2021) too.

\bigskip

But think about it -- do any of us really know how these policies work?  These production functions are obscure.  

\end{frame}




 
\begin{frame}{Don't use Treated controls}

Work together: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y^1_k|Post] - E[Y^0_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y^0_U | Post ] - E[ Y^0_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
\end{eqnarray*}So to summarize:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Control group is never treated (this would apply to spillovers)
\item Treatment status at baseline is the same treatment status as that of controls treatment status
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}







\begin{frame}{What is parallel trends?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends assumes away the selection bias associated with comparisons
\item The assumption is thought to be more plausible than simply assuming simple comparisons held equal $E[Y^0|D=0]=E[Y^0|D=1]$
\item But it is still a strong assumption, and differs from the assumptions have in the RCT which though also untestable, is nearly guaranteed by randomization
\item Most of the hard part of the work involves the old fashioned detective work and the work of making good arguments with good exhibits (tables and figures)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Understanding parallel trends through worksheets}

Before we move into regression, let's go through a simple exercise to really pin down these core ideas with simple calculations

\bigskip 

\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1onabpc14JdrGo6NFv0zCWo-nuWDLLV2L1qNogDT9SBw/edit?usp=sharing}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{No Anticipation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Additional assumption is ``no anticipation'' -- poorly named as it doesn't require literally no anticipation
\item No anticipation means that the treatment effect happens only at the time that the treatment occurs or after, but not before
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Example 1}: Tomorrow I win the lottery, but don't get paid yet. I decide to buy a new house today. That violates NA
	\item \textbf{Example 2}: Next year, a state lets you drive without a driver license and you know it. But you can't drive without a driver license today.  This satisfies NA.
	\end{itemize}
\item We need NA because we are comparing to a baseline period and it needs to not be treated ($[Y^0_k|Pre]$)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{SUTVA}

\begin{itemize}
\item Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (Imbens and Rubin 2015) focuses on what happens when in our analysis we are combining units (versus defining treatment effects)
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{No Interference}: a treated unit cannot impact a control unit such that their potential outcomes change (unstable treatment value)
	\item \textbf{No hidden variation in treatment}: When units are indexed to receive a treatment, their dose is the same as someone else with that same index
	\item \textbf{Scale}: If scaling causes interference or changes inputs in production process, then \#1 or \#2 are violated
	\end{enumerate}
\item Shifts from defining treatment effects to estimating them, which means being careful about who is the control group, how you define treatments and what questions can and cannot be answered with this method
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Event studies}
\begin{frame}{Event studies have become mandatory in DiD}

	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./lecture_includes/currie_eventstudy.png}
	\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Intuition behind event studies}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Princeton Industrial Relations Section seems to be behind this -- this intense focus on research design but also verifying assumptions
	\item The identifying assumption for all DD designs is parallel trends , but since we cannot verify parallel trends, we often look at pre-trends
	\item It's a type of check for selection bias, but you must understand what it is and what it isn't to see its value but not be naive about it (it is not a silver bullet)
	\item Even if pre-trends are the same one still has to worry about other policies changing at the same time (omitted variable bias is a parallel trends violation)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=2.5]{./lecture_includes/waldinger_dd_6.pdf}
	\end{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Beware of naive reasoning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel pre-trends $\neq$ parallel trends -- these are often thought to be the same thing, and they aren't
\item Equating them is a kind of \emph{post hoc ergo propter hoc} fallacy
\item Parallel pre-trends is more like a smoking gun based on things ``looking the same'' before
\item Similar to checking for covariate balance in RCTs
\item But \textbf{cannot} substitute for domain knowledge!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Event study regression}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Event studies have a simple OLS specification with only one treatment group and one never-treated group $$Y_{its} = \alpha +  \sum_{\tau=-2}^{-q}\mu_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+\varepsilon_{ist}$$
		\begin{itemize}
		\item where $D$ is an interaction of the treatment group $s$ with the calendar year $\tau$
		\item Treatment occurs in year 0, no anticipation, drop baseline $t-1$
		\item Includes $q$ leads or anticipatory effects and $m$ lags or post treatment effects
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Event study regression}


$$Y_{its} = \alpha + \sum_{\tau=-2}^{-q}\mu_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+\varepsilon_{ist}$$

\bigskip

Typically you'll plot the coefficients and 95\% CI on all leads and lags (binned or not, trimmed or not) 

\bigskip

Under no anticipation, then you expect $\widehat{\mu}$ coefficients to be zero, which gives you confidence that parallel trends holds (but is not a guarantee, and there are still specification issues -- see Jon Roth's work)

\bigskip

Under parallel trends, $\widehat{\delta}$ are estimates of the ATT at points in time

\section{Including Covariates}

\subsection{Inverse probability weighting}

\begin{frame}{OLS and covariates}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Four averages and three subtractions is numerically identical to OLS
	\item So all you need is parallel trends, NA and SUTVA for either one
	\item OLS is also easy because you can include covariates
	\item But as it turns out (and we will look later) OLS with covariates has additional assumptions under the hood
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Covariates and violations}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is an assumption called ``unconfoundedness'' $$( Y^0, Y^1 ) \perp\!\!\!\perp D | X $$
\item It means that within the dimensions of X (e.g., Asian males aged 45), D is assigned to units independent of their potential outcomes or any combination of them (e.g., treatment effects)
\item It's the basis for running regressions with covariates in order to recover aggregate causal parameters outside of the experiment but it claims that with the inclusion of the covariates, you have isolated a randomized experiment
\item We usually motivate this assumption in diff-in-diff, too, but it is technically not what is going on

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why covariates?}

\begin{itemize}

\item The inclusion of covariates in diff-in-diff models is not about trying to find random variation in the treatment within values of the dimension of X
\item It is based on the claim that the inclusion of covariates is necessary to re-establish parallel trends
\item This is itself different than how covariates will be used in synthetic control, too
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Correcting the missingness problem}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{ATT} &=& E[\delta | D=1] \\
&=& E[Y^1-\textcolor{red}{Y^0} | D=1] \\
&=& E[Y^1 | D=1] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0|D=1]} \\
&=& E[Y | D=1] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0|D=1]} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

We were always missing $Y^0$ values for the treatment group units, but parallel trends allowed us to impute it using the change in $[Y^0]|D=0]$ as a guide

\bigskip

But if that trend is not a good guide, then we cannot.  


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Conditional parallel trends}

The DiD equation yields:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta} &=& \bigg ( E[Y_k|Post] - E[Y_k|Pre] \bigg ) - \bigg ( E[Y_U | Post ] - E[ Y_U | Pre] \bigg) \\
&=& \text{ATT} + \text{Non-parallel trends bias}
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

If we believe that conditional on covariates, parallel trends holds, but only within values of $X$, then there are methods we can use that incorporate covariates into the DiD equation and unbiasedness returns

\bigskip 

The inclusion of covariates has particular regression specifications, plus there are alternative methods too, and we will review them

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Three covariate DiD papers}

Three papers (though sometimes you see others) about covariate adjustment in DiD:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Abadie (2005) on semiparametric DiD -- reweights the comparison group part of the DID equation using a propensity score based on X
\item Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997) on outcome regression uses baseline X and control group only to impute the missing counterfactual $Y^0$ for treatment group units in a DiD equation
\item Sant'Anna and Zhou (2020) is double robust which means the method does both of these at the same time so that you don't have to choose between them
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

We will discuss both of them and then compare their performance with the more straightforward fixed effects model

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Semiparametric DiD}


 Abadie (2005) proposed a model that simply reweights the control group in the DiD equation using a particular specification (``semiparametric'') of the propensity score on pretreatment covariates
 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate each unit's ``after minus before'' (DiD equation)
	\item Estimate the conditional probability of treatment based on baseline covariates (propensity score estimation)
	\item Weight the comparison group's DiD equation with the propensity score 
	\end{enumerate}

Remember -- ATT is only missing $Y^0$ for treatment, so we only have to apply weights to the comparison group units

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Novel elements of time in Abadie's model}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is only one treatment group so therefore there is only one relevant treatment date, $t$
\item The period prior to treatment is called the baseline, or $b$, period and it is when treated units were not treated 
\item $X_b$ are ``baseline'' covariates meaning the value of $X$ in the pre-treatment period for either the treated or comparison group units
\item Propensity scores are estimated off the $b$ period \emph{only} 
\item Abadie ``throws away'' covariates after treatment because this is all about re-establishing parallel trends which is a \emph{baseline} concept recall
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}

Three main assumptions

\begin{enumerate}
\item Conditional parallel trends $$E[Y^0_t - Y^0_b|D=1,X_b] - E[Y^0_t - Y^0_t | D=0, X_b]$$ 
\item Common support $$Pr(D=1)>0; Pr(D=1|X)<1$$ 
\item Propensity score model is properly specified 
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Propensity scores as dimension reduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item Propensity scores are ways of dealing with a conditioning set $X$ that has large dimensions
\item Dimensions are not the same as covariates -- if you have continuous $X$, then it has infinite dimensions
\item Common support means that \emph{within} all combinations of the covariates (e.g., white male 47yo versus whites, males, age) there are units in treatment and control

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Common support example}

Think of common support like ``exact matches'' but on the propensity score

\bigskip

I'm a white male 47 years old with a PhD; can I find a white male 47 years old without a PhD

\bigskip

If I can, that's common support; if I cannot that's off support

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Propensity scores as dimension reduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item Propensity score theorem (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983) showed that if you need $X$ to satisfy some assumption, the propensity score will satisfy too
\item Propensity scores essentially transform your large dimensional problem into a single scalar called the propensity score, which is the conditional probability of treatment (conditional on $X$)
\item But we need to estimate the propensity score because we don't usually know it (only an experimentalist ``knows'' the true propensity score)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Common support and the propensity score}

\begin{itemize}
\item Exact matches mean you have people who are identical on covariate values in both treatment and control
\item Common support and the propensity score means you have people nearly identical on their probability of treatment
\item I am 47yo white male with a PhD with a propensity score of 0.75, but you are an Asian female 27yo without a PhD and have a propensity score of 0.75
\item Same idea, but for this to work, we need to have ``matches'' like that (just on the propensity score)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{How do these work together?}

Since we are identifying the ATT, and the ATT is missing $Y^0$ for the treated group, we are using the control group $Y^0$ in its place 

\bigskip

Under conditional parallel trends and common support, some of the comparison group units are recovering the parallel trends because of their $X$ values creating projections that in their differences perfectly aligned in expectation with the missing $\Delta E[Y^0|D=1]$

\bigskip

But we have to have all three for it to work

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Visualizing propensity score to get common support}

	\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.05]{./lecture_includes/common_support_abadie.png}
	\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition and estimation}

Defining the ATT parameter of interest
\begin{eqnarray*}
ATT &=& E[Y^1_t - \textcolor{red}{Y^0_t} |D=1] \\
&=&E[Y^1_t  | D = 1 ] - \textcolor{red}{E[Y^0_t | D=1]}
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip
Abadie's inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\bigg [ \frac{Y_t - Y_b}{Pr(D_t=1)} \times \frac{D_t - Pr(D=1|X_b)}{1-Pr(D=1|X_b)} \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

The first is our causal parameter; the second is our reweighted DiD equation that \emph{estimates} our causal parameter, but we need to estimate that propensity score


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Abadie's IPW estimator}

Look closely; what happens mathematically when you substitute $D=1$ vs $D=0$?

\begin{eqnarray*}
E\bigg [ \frac{Y_t - Y_b}{Pr(D_t=1)} \times \frac{D_t - Pr(D=1|X_b)}{1-Pr(D=1|X_b)} \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

The reweighting with the propensity only happens to the comparison group's first differences -- not the treatment groups!  Why?  Because it's the $Y^0$ that is missing, not the $Y^1$

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Propensity scores}

\begin{itemize}
\item It's common to hear people say that we don't know the propensity score; we can only estimate it. Same here -- we approximate it with regressions
\item Paper is titled ``Semi-parametric DiD'' because Abadie imposes structure on the polynomials used to construct the propensity score (``series logit'')
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Doubly Robust Difference-in-differences}

\begin{itemize}
\item DR models control for covariates twice -- once using the propensity score, once using outcomes adjusted by regression -- and are unbiased so long as:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The regression specification for the outcome is correctly specified
	\item The propensity score specification is correctly specified
	\end{itemize}
\item Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) incorporated DR into DiD by combining inverse probability weighting and outcome regression into a single DiD model
\item It's in the engine of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) that we discuss later so it merits close study
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Identification assumptions I: Data}

Assumption 1: Assume panel data or repeated cross-sectional data

\bigskip

Handling repeated cross-sectional data is possible but assumes stationarity which is a kind of stability assumption, but I'll use panel representation. 

\bigskip

Cross-sections will be potentially violated with changing sample compositions (e.g., the Napster example). 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification assumptions II: Modification to parallel trends}

Assumption 2: Conditional parallel trends

\bigskip

Counterfactual trends for the treatment group are the same as the control group for all values of $X$

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y_1^0 - Y_0^0 | X, D=1] = E[Y^0_1 - Y^0_0 | X, D=0]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identification assumptions III: Common support}

Assumption 3: Common support

\bigskip

For some $e>0$, the probability of being in the treatment group is greater than $e$ and the probability of being in the treatment group conditional on $X$ is $\leq1-e$. 

\bigskip

Heckman, et al doesn't use the propensity score so we need a more general expression of support

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimating DD with Assumptions 1-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumptions 1-3 gives us a couple of options of estimating the DiD
\item We can either use the outcome regression (OR) approach of Heckman, et al 1997 (will require correct model too)
\item Or we can use the inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach of Abadie (2005) (will require correct model too)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Outcome regression}

This is the Heckman, et al. (1997) approach where the potential outcome evolution for the treatment group is imputed with a regression based only on $X_b$ for the control group \emph{only}

\bigskip

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{OR} = \overline{Y}_{1,1} - \bigg [ \overline{Y}_{1,0} + \frac{1}{n^T} \sum_{i|D_i=1} ( \widehat{\mu}_{0,1}(X_i) - \widehat{\mu}_{0,0}(X_i)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\overline{Y}$ is the sample average of $Y$ among units in the treatment group at time $t$ and $\widehat{\mu}(X)$ is an estimator of the true, but unknown, $m_{d,t}(X)$ which is by definition equal to $E[Y_t|D=d,X=x]$.

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Outcome regression}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{OR} = \overline{Y}_{1,1} - \bigg [ \overline{Y}_{1,0} + \frac{1}{n^T} \sum_{i|D_i=1} ( \widehat{\mu}_{0,1}(X_i) - \widehat{\mu}_{0,0}(X_i)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Regress changes $\Delta Y$ on $X$ among untreated groups using baseline covariates only
\item Get fitted values of the regression using all $X$ from $D=1$ only.  Average those
\item Calculate change in this fitted $Y$ among treated with the average fitted values
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inverse probability weighting}

This is the Abadie (2005) approach where we use weighting

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{ipw} = \frac{1}{E_N[D]} E \bigg [ \frac{D-\widehat{p}(X)}{1-\widehat{p}(X)} (Y_1-Y_0) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\widehat{p}(X)$ is an estimator for the true propensity score. Reduces the dimensionality of $X$ into a single scalar.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{These models cannot be ranked}

\begin{itemize}
\item Outcome regression needs $\widehat{\mu}(X)$ to be correctly specified, whereas
\item Inverse probability weighting needs $\widehat{p}(X)$ to be correctly specified
\item It's hard to ``rank'' these two in practice with regards to model misspecification because each is inconsistent when their own models are misspecified
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{TWFE}

Consider our earlier TWFE specification:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{it} = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 T_t + \alpha_3 D_i +  \delta (T_i \times D_t)  + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Just add in covariates then right?

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{it} = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 T_t + \alpha_3 D_i  + \delta (T_i \times D_t) + \theta \cdot X_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{eqnarray*}

Sure! If you're willing to impose three \emph{more} assumptions

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Decomposing TWFE with covariates}

TWFE places restrictions on the DGP. Previous TWFE regression under assumptions 1-3 implies the following:

\bigskip

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y^1_1|D=1,X] = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Conditional parallel trends implies

\small
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&E[Y^0_{1} - Y^0_{0}|D=1,X]= E[Y^0_{1} - Y^0_{0}|D=0,X] \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] - E[Y^0_{0}|D=1,X]= E[Y^0_{1}|D=0,X] - E[Y^0_{0}|D=0,X] \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = E[Y^0_{0}|D=1,X] + E[Y^0_{1}|D=0,X] - E[Y^0_{0}|D=0,X] \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = E[Y_{0}|D=1,X] + E[Y_{1}|D=0,X] - E[Y_{0}|D=0,X] \\
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Switching equation substitution}

Last line from the switching equation. This gives us:

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \theta X
\end{eqnarray*}

Now compare this with our earlier $Y^1$ expression

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y^1_1|D=1,X] = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X
\end{eqnarray*}

We can define our target parameter, the ATT, now in terms of the fixed effects representation

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Collecting terms}

TWFE representation of our conditional expectations of the potential outcomes
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&E[Y^1_1|D=1,X] = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta_1 X \\
&&E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X] = \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \theta_2 X \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Substitute these into our target parameter

\begin{eqnarray*}
ATT &=& E[Y^1_1|D=1,X]  - E[Y^0_{1}|D=1,X]   \\
&&=(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta_1 X) - ( \alpha_1  + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \theta_2 X )\\
&&=\delta + (\theta_1 X - \theta_2 X)
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

What if $\theta_1 X \neq \theta_2 X$?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumption 4: Homogeneous treatment effects in X}


TWFE requires homogenous treatment effects in $X$ (i.e., the treatment effect is the same for all $X$)

\bigskip

If $X$ is sex, then effects are the same for males and females.

\bigskip

  If $X$ is continuous, like income, then the effect is the same whether someone makes \$1 or \$1 million.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{X-specific trends}

TWFE also places restrictions on covariate trends for the two groups too.  Take conditional expectations of our TWFE equation. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y_1|D=1] &=& \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X_{11} \\
E[Y_0|D=1] &=& \alpha_1 + \alpha_3 + \theta X_{10} \\
E[Y_1|D=0] &=& \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \theta X_{01} \\
E[Y_0|D=0] &=& \alpha_1 + \theta X_{00}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{X-specific trends}

Now take the DiD formula:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{DD} = &&\bigg ( (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \delta + \theta X_{11} ) - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 + \theta X_{10} ) \bigg )- \\
&& \bigg ( (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \theta X_{01}) - (\alpha_1 + \theta X_{00}) \bigg )
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Eliminating terms, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{DD} = &&\delta + \\
&& (\theta X_{11} - \theta X_{10} ) - (\theta X_{01} - \theta X_{00} )
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Second line requires that trends in X for treatment group equal trends in X for control group.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 5 and 6}

We need ``no X-specific trends'' for the treatment group (assumption 5) and comparison group (assumption 6)

\bigskip

\textbf{Intuition}: No X-specific trends means the evolution of potential outcome $Y^0$ is the same regardless of $X$. This would mean you cannot allow rich people to be on a different trend than poor people, for instance.

\bigskip

Without these six, in general TWFE will not identify ATT. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why not both?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let's review the problem.  What if you claim you need $X$ for conditional parallel trends?
\item You have three options:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Outcome regression (Heckman, et al. 1997) -- needs Assumptions 1-3
	\item Inverse probability weighting (Abadie 2005) -- needs Assumptions 1-3
	\item TWFE (everybody everywhere all the time) -- needs Assumptions 1-6
	\end{enumerate}
\item Problem is 1 and 2 need the models to be correctly specified
\item Doubly robust combines them to give us insurance; we now get two chances to be wrong, as opposed to just one
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Double Robust DiD}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{dr} = E \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac{D}{E[D]} -\frac{ \frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} }{E \bigg [\frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} \bigg ]} \bigg  )( \Delta Y - \mu_{0,\Delta}(X)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
&&p(x): \text{propensity score model} \\
&& \Delta Y = Y_1 - Y_0 = Y_{post} - Y_{pre} \\
&& \mu_{d,\Delta} = \mu_{d,1}(X) - \mu_{d,0}(X), \text{ where } \mu(X) \text{ is a model for} \\
&& m_{d,t} = E[Y_t|D=d,X=x]
\end{eqnarray*}So that means $\mu_{0,\Delta}$ is just the control group's change in average $Y$ for each $X=x$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Double Robust DiD}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta^{dr} = E \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac{D}{E[D]} -\frac{ \frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} }{E \bigg [\frac{p(X)(1-D)}{(1-p(X))} \bigg ]} \bigg  )( \Delta Y - \mu_{0,\Delta}(X)) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

Notice how the model controls for $X$: you're weighting the adjusted outcomes using the propensity score

\bigskip

The reason you control for $X$ twice is because you don't know which model is right.  DR DiD frees you from making a choice without making you pay too much for it


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Efficiency}

\begin{itemize}
\item Authors exploit all the restrictions implied by the assumptions to construct semiparametric bounds
\item This is where the influence function comes in, which those who have studied the DID code closely may have noticed
\item One of the main results of the paper is that the DR DiD estimator is also DR for inference
\item Let's skip to Monte Carlos
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Description of NSW Job Trainings Program}
	
The National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW), operated by Manpower Demonstration Research Corp in the mid-1970s:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item was a temporary employment program designed to help disadvantaged workers lacking basic job skills move into the labor market by giving them work experience and counseling in a sheltered environment
	\item was also unique in that it \textbf{randomly assigned} qualified applicants to training positions:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Treatment group}: received all the benefits of NSW program
		\item \textbf{Control group}: left to fend for themselves
		\end{itemize}
	\item admitted AFDC females, ex-drug addicts, ex-criminal offenders, and high school dropouts of both sexes
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NSW Program}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Treatment group members were:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item guaranteed a job for 9-18 months depending on the target group and site
		\item divided into crews of 3-5 participants who worked together and met frequently with an NSW counselor to discuss grievances and performance
		\item paid for their work
		\end{itemize}
	\item Control group members were randomized so the same
	\item Note: the randomization balanced observables and unobservables across the two arms, thus enabling the estimation of an ATE for the people who self-selected into the program
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NSW Program}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Other details about the NSW program:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \underline{Wages}:  NSW offered the trainees lower wage rates than they would've received on a regular job, but allowed their earnings to increase for satisfactory performance and attendance
		\item \underline{Post-treatment}: after their term expired, they were forced to find regular employment
		\item \underline{Job types}:  varied within sites -- gas station attendant, working at a printer shop -- and males and females were frequently performing different kinds of work
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
	
\begin{frame}{NSW Data}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{NSW data collection}:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item MDRC collected earnings and demographic information from both treatment and control at baseline and every 9 months thereafter
		\item Conducted up to 4 post-baseline interviews
		\item Different sample sizes from study to study can be confusing, but has simple explanations
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
	

\begin{frame}{NSW Data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{Estimation}:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item NSW was a randomized job trainings program; therefore estimating the average treatment effect is straightforward:
			\begin{eqnarray*}
			\frac{1}{N_t}\sum_{D_i=1}Y_i - \frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{D_i=0}Y_i \approx E[Y^1-Y^0] 
			\end{eqnarray*}in large samples assuming treatment selection is independent of potential outcomes (randomization) -- i.e., $(Y^0,Y^1)\independent{D}$. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item \underline{NSW worked}: Treatment group participants' real earnings post-treatment (1978) was positive and economically meaningful -- $\approx$ \$900 (LaLonde 1986) to \$1,800 (Dehejia and Wahba 2002) depending on the sample used
\end{itemize}

\underline{LaLonde's study} was \textbf{not} an evaluation of the NSW program, as that had been done, but rather an evaluation of econometric models done by:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item replacing the experimental NSW control group with non-experimental control group drawn from two nationally representative survey datasets: Current Population Survey (CPS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
		\item estimating the average effect using non-experimental workers as controls for the NSW trainees 
		\item comparing his non-experimental estimates to the experimental estimates of \$900
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{LaLonde (1986)}

\begin{itemize}

	\item \underline{LaLonde's conclusion}: available econometric approaches were biased and inconsistent
		\begin{itemize}
		\item His estimates were way off and usually the wrong sign
		\item Conclusion was influential in policy circles and led to greater push for more experimental evaluations
		\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Including covariates in a DiD design is done for reasons that are different than in regressions more generally -- we are trying to address a parallel trends violation
\item TWFE can only incorporate \emph{time varying} covariates, and that places restrictions on the model, whereas other methods will not
\item Doubly robust and IPW incorporate covariates through propensity scores and outcome regressions (or both) using baseline covariate means only
\end{itemize}
